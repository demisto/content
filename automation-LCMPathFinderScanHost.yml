comment: "Scan a host using LightCyber Magna's \"PathFinder\" agent (\"Pathfinder
  OnDemand\").\nThis is the equivalent of pressing the Pathfinder OnDemand button
  in the Magna UI. \n\nOnDemand pathfinder scans are typically performed after a host
  is suspected (this is done automatically by Magna, but a reason external to Magna
  can cause suspicion in this case). After pathfinder is launched the following is
  achieved:\n* As a result of the scan pathfinder can find Malware or Riskware\n*
  Suspicious artifacts (a list of rare and suspicious executables) can be used for
  further investigation"
