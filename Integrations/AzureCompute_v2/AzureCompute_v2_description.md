To allow us access to Azure Compute, an administrator has to approve the Demisto app using an admin consent flow, by clicking [here](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-azure-compute).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will receive an ID, Token, and Key, which needs to be added to the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields. After giving consent, the application must have a role assigned, so it can access the relevant resources per subscription. 
For more information, see the integration documentation.
