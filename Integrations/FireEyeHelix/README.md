Use the FireEye Helix integration to integrate security tools and arguments with next-generation SIEM, orchestration and threat intelligence tools such as alert management, search, analysis, investigations and reporting.

In order to configure this integration you must have a FireEye customer ID. Your customer ID will placed in the FireEye Helix URL of your FireEye Helix app after `/helix/id/`. e.g. for the following URL `https://apps.fireeye.com/helix/id/"helixid"` the customer ID is "helixid".

The API key can be found and generated in the **API KEYS** section. You can navigate to it from your FireEye Helix app home page by clicking on the **user icon** on the top right, and choosing **HELIX Settings**. You'll be redirected to the **HELIX Settings** page, where API KEYS can be found.
