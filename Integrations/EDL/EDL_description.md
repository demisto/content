# How to Access the EDL Service

There are two ways that you can access the EDL service:
- **https://*demisto_address*/instance/execute/*instance_name*** 
- **http(s)://*demisto_address*:*listen_port***

# Access the EDL Service by Instance Name
To access the EDL service by instance name, make sure ***Instance execute external*** is enabled. 

1. In Demisto, go to **Settings > About > Troubleshooting**.
2. In the **Server Configuration** section, verify that the ***instance.execute.external*** key is set to *true*. If this key does not exist, click **+ Add Server Configuration** and add the *instance.execute.external* and set the value to *true*.
