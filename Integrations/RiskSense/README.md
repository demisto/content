## Overview
---

RiskSense is a cloud based platform that provides vulnerability management and prioritization to measure and control cybersecurity risk.
This integration was integrated and tested with version xx of RiskSense

## Use Cases
---
The SOAR market is still an emerging market and is often used as an umbrella term that covers security operations, security incident response and threat intelligence. Many vendors, even market leaders  like Splunk, are adding features and functionality to their existing solutions in the fight for market leadership. One major commonality between new SOAR vendors and vendors trying to make their existing solution fit into this market definition is the need to be able to ingest security centric data including threat intelligence to address the biggest use-case for SOAR i.e. security operations. 

Gartner claims that organizations need to have a continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment (CARTA) strategy to make their investments in SOAR technology pay off. CARTA’s value is that it is continuous, and one element helps and informs other elements, allowing for continuous improvement in your organization’s ability to improve both security posture and digital resilience.

## Configure RiskSense on Demisto
---

### 1. risksense-get-hosts
---
Look up the host details. The host details can be searched based on input parameters like fieldname (hostname, ipaddress, criticality, etc), operator (EXACT, IN, LIKE), page, size, sort by and sort order.

##### Base Command

`risksense-get-hosts`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldname | The RiskSense host field that should be considered for filtering the results. Users can specify any RiskSense field which use to filter. If specified, the 'value' argument is mandatory. | Optional | 
| operator | The match operator should be applied for filtering the hosts based on 'fieldname' and 'value'. Available options are 'EXACT' - filter records exactly matching the criteria; 'IN' - filter records matching any one of the comma-separated values;'LIKE' - filter records with specific pattern provided. | Optional | 
| exclusive_operator | The exclusive operator flag that determines whether the returned records matches filter criteria or not. By default set to False. If set to True, host not matching the specified values are fetched. | Optional | 
| value | The value of the host property mentioned in 'fieldname' to be considered for filter criteria. | Optional | 
| page | Te index of the page. The index is numeric value starting with 0. | Optional | 
| size | The maximum number of records to be fetched in one page. | Optional | 
| sort_by | The fieldname that should be considered for sorting the returned records. | Optional | 
| sort_order | The sorting order to be considered for returned records. | Optional |

### Group Name:

Default Group

### Host Finding Description:

Solaris 10 and 11 hosts are vulnerable to a telnet daemon flaw.

The telnet daemon passes switches directly to the login process which
looks for a switch that allows root to login to any account without a
password. If your telnet daemon is running as root it allows
unauthenticated remote login.

Telnet poses a risk because data transferred between clients may not be
encrypted. Telnet is also a frequent target for port scanners.
