description: "SlashNext Phishing Incident Response integration allows Demisto users
  to fully automate analysis of suspicious URLs. For example, IR teams responsible
  for abuse inbox management can extract links or domains out of suspicious emails
  and automatically analyze them with the SlashNext SEER threat detection cloud to
  get definitive, binary verdicts (malicious or benign) along with IOCs, screen shots,
  and more. Automating URL analysis can save IR teams hundreds of hours versus manually
  triaging these emails or checking URLs and domains against less accurate phishing
  databases and domain reputation services."
