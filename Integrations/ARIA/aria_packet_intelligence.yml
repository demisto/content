description: 'The ARIA Cybesecurity Solutions Software-Defined Security (SDS)  platform
  integrates with Demisto to add robustness when responding to incidents. The combination
  of ARIA hardware, in the form of a Secure Intelligent Adapter (SIA), and software,
  specifically Packet Intelligence and SDS orchestrator (SDSo), provides the elements
  required to react instantly when an incident is detected. When integrated with the
  ARIA solution, you can create playbooks that instruct one or more SIAs to add, modify,
  or delete rules automatically. These rule changes, which take effect immediately,
  can block conversations, redirect packets to a recorder or VLAN, or perform a variety
  of other actions. '
detaileddescription: Users should install SDSo onto a server according to the instructions in
  Software-Defined Security Installation Guide. During the installation process you can determine the IP
  address or FQDN of your SDSo instance which is used in the SDSo Base URL. You should also install
  an SIA according to the Secure Intelligent Adapter Installation Guide. For more information on
  connecting an SDSo and SIA see the Software-Defined Security Orchestrator User Guide. In addition,
  you must deploy the PI security service to your SIA, see the Packet Intelligence User Guide for more information.
