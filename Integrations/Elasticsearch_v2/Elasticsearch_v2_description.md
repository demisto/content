The Elasticsearch v2 integration supports Elasticsearch 6.0.0 and later.

Strings are queried using the Lucene syntax. For more information about the Lucene syntax, see: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax

For further information about request response fields, see: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-explain

For further information about type mapping, see: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/mapping.html#mapping-type

Note: Not all fields can be sorted in Elasticsearch. The fields are used to sort the results table.  The supported result types are boolean, numeric, date, and keyword fields.
