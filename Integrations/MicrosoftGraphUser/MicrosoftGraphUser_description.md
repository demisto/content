To allow us access to the security graph, an admin has to authorize Demisto app using an admin consent flow by clicking on the following [link](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=a7a86867-d2ba-4528-8831-74bc84a700b2&redirect_uri=https://demistobot.demisto.com/msg-user).
For more informatoin, see the [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview).
After Demisto app is authorized, you will get a tenant ID, which should be inserted in the integration instance settings.
