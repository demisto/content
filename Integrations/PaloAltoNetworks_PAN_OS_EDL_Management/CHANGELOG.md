## [Unreleased]
- Fixed: !pan-os-edl-update does't work with file path including space charactors at scp_execute().

## [19.8.0] - 2019-08-06
  - Added the ***pan-os-edl-get-external-file-metadata*** command.
  - When a non-existent list is specified in the ***pan-os-edl-update-from-external-file*** command, the list is automatically created, and the file data is saved to the list.
