To allow us access to Microsoft Teams, an admin has to approve our app using an admin consent flow, by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy-dev.demisto.ninja/ms-teams).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key, which should be inserted in the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.
