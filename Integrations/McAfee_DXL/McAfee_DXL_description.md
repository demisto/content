## Prerequisite - Connect to McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) using the DXL TIE Client
To connect the McAfee TIE using the DXL TIE client, you need to create certificates and configure DXL. For more information, see the [OpenDXL documentation](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/index.html). After you complete this configuration, you will have the following files.
   * Broker CA certificates ('brokercerts.crt' file)
   * Client certificate ('client.crt' file)
   * Client private key ('client.key' file)
   * Broker list properties file ('brokerlist.properties' file)

**Important**: these are the actual certificates, not request certificates.
