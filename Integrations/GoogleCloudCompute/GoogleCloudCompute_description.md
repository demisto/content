Create a Service Account
1. Go to the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount) and follow the procedure in the Creating a Service Account section. After you create a service account, a Service Account Private Key file is downloaded. You will need this file when configuring an instance of the integration.
2. Grant the Compute Admin permission to the Service Account to enable the Service Account to perform certain Google Cloud API commands.
3. In Demisto, configure an instance of the Google Cloud Compute integration. For the Service Account Private Key parameter, add the Service Account Private Key file contents (JSON).
