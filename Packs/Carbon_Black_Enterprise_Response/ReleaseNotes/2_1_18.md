#### Integrations
##### VMware Carbon Black EDR v2
- Fixed an issue where IP addresses fetched with **cb-edr-process-event-list** command were not shown in human-readable format. The integration now converts ip addresses to human-readable format. (e.g from 167772448 to 10.0.1.32).
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.5.31928*.
