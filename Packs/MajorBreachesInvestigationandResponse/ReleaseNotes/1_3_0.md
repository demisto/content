##### New: FireEye Red Team Tools Investigation and Response
- This playbook does the following:

Collect indicators to aid in your threat hunting process.
- Retrieve IOCs of FireEye red team tools.
- Discover IOCs of associated activity related to the infection.
- Generate an indicator list to block indicators with SUNBURST tags.

Hunt for the indicators
- Search endpoints with the FireEye red team tools CVEs.
- Search endpoint logs for FireEye red team tools hashes.
- Search and link previous incidents with the FireEye hashes.

If compromised hosts are found, fire off sub-playbooks to isolate/quarantine infected hosts/endpoints and await further actions from the security team.
