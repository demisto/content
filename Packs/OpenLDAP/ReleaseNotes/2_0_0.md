#### Integrations
##### LDAP Authentication
- Added support for secured connection to the LDAP server by **Start TLS**. You can use this option by setting the *Connection Type* parameter to 'Start TLS'. 
- You can now use this integration to connect an **Active Directory** LDAP server, and log in to Cortex XSOAR with Active Directory users.
