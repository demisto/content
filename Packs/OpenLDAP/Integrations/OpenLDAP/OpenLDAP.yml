      name: search_base
      required: false
    - description: A string that describes what you are searching for. When provided with additional filter arguments, the OR join operator is used. If not provided, and no other filter arguments are present, all entries are returned. Search filters are based on assertions. One assertion is a bracketed expression that affirms something about an attribute and its values, as (givenName=John) or (maxRetries>=10). On the server, each assertion resolves to True, False, or Undefined (which is treated as False) for one or more entries in the DIT. Assertions can be grouped in boolean groups where all assertions (and group, specified with &) or at least one assertion (or group, specified with |) must be True. A single assertion can be negated (not group, specified with !). Each group must be bracketed, allowing for recursive filters. Operators allowed in an assertion are = (equal), <= (less than or equal), >= (greater than or equal), =* (present), ~= (approximate), and := (extensible). Surprisingly the less than and the greater than operators donâ€™t exist in the LDAP filter syntax. The aproximate and the extensible operators are obscure and seldom used. In an equality filter you can use the * character as a wildcard.
