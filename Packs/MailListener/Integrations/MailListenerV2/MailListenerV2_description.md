This integration allows listening to a mailbox and spawn an incident from the receipt of the email.
While this integration is designed to work with any IMAP server such as AT&T, Yahoo, BT Connect, etc.
If You are using Exchange on-premise, Exchange Online, or Gmail - we do recommend working with the product specific integrations.

If the IMAP server requires client certificates and private keys, please configure the **Client Certificate And Private Key (List of PEMs)** parameter with the appropriate keys.
