## Tessian Cloud Email Security Platform

To configure an instance of Tessian integration in Cortex XSOAR:

1. Provide your 'Portal URL'. This is the full url that you use to access your Tessian portal. It should look something like  "example.tessian-platform.com" or "example.tessian-app.com".

2. Provide your 'API Key':

    You can create your api token via your Tessian Portal (your_tessian_url.com/0/admin/integrations/api/tokens). In your Tessian portal you can:
    - Navigate to **Integrations** > **Security Integrations** > **Tessian API**
    - Select **Create New Token**
    - Select a name for the token
    - Copy the API token

    Please store the API token you are given securely as it will only be shown upon creation for security reasons. This token
    provides access to your sensitive data, if you lose access to it we recommend deleting it from the Tessian portal and creating another one. If you think that your token has been compromised, please delete the token from your portal and contact your Account Manager.
