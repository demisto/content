#### Authenticate with an API token
In new Cuckoo installations, a random API token is automatically generated for you, and located in the cuckoo.conf file. In order to authenticate with an API token, insert '__token' in the "Username" textbox, and the token itself in the "Password" textbox.

Notice: Submitting indicators using the **cuckoo-create-task-from-url** command of this integration might make the indicator data publicly available.  See the vendorâ€™s documentation for more details
