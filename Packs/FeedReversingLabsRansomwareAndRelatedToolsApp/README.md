## What is the ReversingLabs Ransomware and Related Tools Feed integration pack?
**This pack installs the ReversingLabs Ransomware and Related Tools Feed integration.**


ReversingLabs Ransomware and Related Tools Feed includes fresh indicators from not only ransomware but the tools used 
to gain access and deploy ransomware enabling defenders the opportunity to discover adversaries initial network access 
and lateral movement before their data is encrypted. Our threat intelligence researchers analyze ransomware attack 
trends and the security landscape to ensure that only the most up to date and relevant malware families are dissected 
to create technical indicators.

## Key Features
* Indicators from multiple stages of typical attacks allow for early detection and the ability to reduce damage associated with IP theft and ransomware attacks.
* Aggressive aging of the indicators ensures only relevant indicators are active in the list.
* Extensive post processing of indicators eliminates or reduces confidence on indicators likely to produce false positives.
* Indicators such as IP, Domain, URI and Hash include tagging to give additional context such as MITRE ATT&CK, network parameters, attack stage and malware family name
