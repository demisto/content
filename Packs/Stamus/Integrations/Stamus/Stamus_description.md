## Stamus Security Platform Integration Help

### Introduction

This integration connect XSOAR with Stamus Security Platform (SSP). It allows XSOAR
to fetch Declaration of Compromises from SSP and to enrich events with metadata and
Host Insights information.

### API key generation

To access the REST-API, a user first need to generate a unique token associated to its account. The API accesses are made on the behalf of a given user.

To do that, login to SCS and go under your account settings from the top right of the headerâ€™s menu.

From the left side panel, under User Settings, select Edit Token.

If you already generated a token for this account, it will be presented in the Token field, otherwise this field will be empty.

In both cases, to generate a new token, simply click the Regenerate button at the bottom of the page and you should see the Token field updated with a hash value such as 3064d9deadbeef36436daba5531e105123ec0fee.

### Setting up the Integration

To set up the integration you need to specify the base address of the server like `https://scs.my.org/` and the API keys.

Additional options are available such as `Don't Trust any certificate (not secure)` that you need to check if a
recognized certificate as not been deployed on the Stamus Central Server.
