# HYAS Insight
HYAS Insight is a threat investigation and attribution solution that uses exclusive data sources and non-traditional mechanisms to improve visibility and productivity for analysts, researchers, and investigators while increasing the accuracy of findings. HYAS Insight connects attack instances and campaigns to billions of indicators of compromise to deliver insights and visibility. With an easy-to-use user interface, transforms, and API access, HYAS Insight combines rich threat data into a powerful research and attribution solution. HYAS Insight is complemented by the HYAS Intelligence team that helps organizations to better understand the nature of the threats they face on a daily basis.

Use the HYAS Insight integration to interactively lookup PassiveDNS, DynamicDNS, WHOIS, Malware and C2 Attribution Information – either as playbook tasks or through API calls in the War Room.
