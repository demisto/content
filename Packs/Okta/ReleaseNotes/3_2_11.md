#### Integrations

##### Okta v2

- *API Token* field is no longer required when configuring an instance using OAuth authentication.  
  Since the API token was previously used to set the app with a "Super Administrator" role, this role will be needed to be set manually for newly created apps (see [the documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/okta-v2#oauth-20-authentication-prerequisites) for more information).
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/crypto:1.0.0.87358*.
