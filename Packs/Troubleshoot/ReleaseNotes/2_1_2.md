#### Scripts

##### New: TroubleshootCloseAlertsByQuery

- New: Closes alerts by receiving a list of alert IDs and executing the closure process for each.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.10.115887*.

##### New: TroubleshootExecutePlaybookByAlertQuery

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.10.115887*.
- New: Retrieves alerts based on a given query and filter arguments. It provides two operational modes:
1. Trigger Associated Playbooks: If no specific playbook is provided, the script automatically triggers the playbook that is individually associated with each alert found.
2. Override Playbook: If a specific playbook ID or name is provided, the script overrides the default playbooks of all matching alerts and uniformly applies the specified playbook to each one.

This automation runs using the default Limited User role, unless you explicitly change the permissions.
