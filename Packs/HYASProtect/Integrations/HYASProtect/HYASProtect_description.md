# HYAS Protect
HYAS Protect is a generational leap forward utilizing authoritative knowledge of attacker infrastructure including unrivaled domain-based intelligence to proactively protect enterprises from cyberattacks. HYAS Protect is deployed as a cloud-based DNS security solution or through API integration with existing solutions. HYAS Protect combines infrastructure expertise and multi-variant communication pattern analysis to deliver reputational verdicts for any domain and infrastructure, allowing enterprises to preempt attacks while proactively assessing risk in real-time. HYAS Protect can enforce security, block command and control (C2) communication used by malware, ransomware, and botnets, block phishing attacks, and deliver a high-fidelity threat signal that enhances an enterprise’s existing security and IT governance stack.

Use the HYAS Protect integration to get the verdict information for FQDN, IP Address and NameServer.
