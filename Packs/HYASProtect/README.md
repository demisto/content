# HYAS Protect
HYAS Protect is a generational leap forward utilizing authoritative knowledge of attacker infrastructure including unrivaled domain-based intelligence to proactively protect enterprises from cyberattacks. HYAS Protect is deployed as a cloud-based DNS security solution or through API integration with existing solutions. HYAS Protect combines infrastructure expertise and multi-variant communication pattern analysis to deliver reputational verdicts for any domain and infrastructure, allowing enterprises to preempt attacks while proactively assessing risk in real-time. HYAS Protect can enforce security, block command and control (C2) communication used by malware, ransomware, and botnets, block phishing attacks, and deliver a high-fidelity threat signal that enhances an enterpriseâ€™s existing security and IT governance stack.

Use the HYAS Protect integration to get the verdict information for FQDN, IP Address and NameServer. This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0.0 of HYAS Protect.
