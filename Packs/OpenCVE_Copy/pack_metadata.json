    "description": "OpenCVE is a platform used to locally import the list of CVEs and perform searches on it (by vendors, products, CVSS, CWE…).\nUsers subscribe to vendors or products and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE.\nYou can manually install OpenCVE, or use docker. We also provide a running instance on https://www.opencve.io if you don’t want to host it yourself.",
