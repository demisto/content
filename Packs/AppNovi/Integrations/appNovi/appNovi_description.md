## appNovi API Token

You will need an API token from your appNovi installation. You will find the API token (`api_token`)
in the appNovi UI via Configuration..Credentials.

If `api_token` is not defined, you'll need to create one. If it's defined already, you'll need
to either fetch it from your password manager or reset it.

Make sure the `api_token` credential `name` box is set to "value" for optimal guacamole production.
