#### Integrations

##### Rasterize


- Updated the ***rasterize*** command to not rasterize local files.
- Fixed an issue where the ***rasterize*** command would repeatedly attempt to rasterize an invalid URL, causing a timeout error. Now, retry attempts are only performed for the following commands ***rasterize-email***, ***rasterize-html***, and ***rasterize-image***.

Fixed an issue where the integration would time out when processing IP addresses with leading zeros. The integration commands have been updated to automatically remove leading zeros from IP addresses ensuring valid formatting and preventing timeout errors.
