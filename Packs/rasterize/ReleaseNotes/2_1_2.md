##### Rasterize

- Updated the ***rasterize*** command to not rasterize local files.
- Fixed an issue where the ***rasterize*** command would repeatedly attempt to rasterize an invalid URL, causing a timeout error. Now, retry attempts are only performed for the following commands ***rasterize-email***, ***rasterize-html***, and ***rasterize-image***.
