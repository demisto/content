##### Rasterize
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/chromium:116.0.5845.72863*.
- Fixed an issue where `https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json` end point would be called by the integration, potentially conflicting with the docker network hardening.
