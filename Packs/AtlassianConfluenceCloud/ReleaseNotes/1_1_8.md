#### Integrations

##### Atlassian Confluence Cloud

- Added support for OAuth 2.0 authentication as an alternative to Basic authentication (email + API token).
- Users can now choose between Basic and OAuth authentication methods.
- OAuth authentication requires Client ID, Client Secret, and Cloud ID from the Atlassian Developer Console.
- Updated the integration to use the AtlassianApiModule for OAuth token management.
- Added the following new commands for OAuth 2.0 authentication management:
  - ***confluence-cloud-oauth-start*** - Starts the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and returns an authorization URL.
  - ***confluence-cloud-oauth-complete*** - Completes the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow by exchanging the authorization code for tokens.
  - ***confluence-cloud-oauth-test*** - Tests the OAuth 2.0 authentication by verifying the current access token is valid.
