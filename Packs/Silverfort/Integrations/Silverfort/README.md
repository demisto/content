Silverfort protects organizations from data breaches by delivering strong authentication across entire corporate networks and cloud environments, without requiring any modifications to endpoints or servers. Using patent-pending technology, Silverfort's agentless approach enables multi-factor authentication and AI-driven adaptive authentication even for systems that donâ€™t support it today, including proprietary systems, critical infrastructure, shared folders, IoT devices, and more.
