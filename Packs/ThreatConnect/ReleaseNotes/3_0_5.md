##### ThreatConnect v3
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.12.63474*.
- Added the *fields_to_return* argument to the **tc-get-indicators-by-tag**, **tc-get-indicator** and **tc-indicators** commands. 
This will allow specifying additional fields to return as part of the result.  
- Cleaned the integration code from unused functionalities.
