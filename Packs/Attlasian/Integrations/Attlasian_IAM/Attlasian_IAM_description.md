## Configure the integration
From your organization at admin.atlassian.com: 
1. Select Settings and then API keys.
2. Click Create API key in the top right.
3. Enter a name that you’ll remember to identify the API key.
By default, the key expires one week from today. If you’d like to change the expiration date, pick a new date under Expires on. You’re unable to select a date longer than a year from the date of creation.
4. Click Create to save the API key.
5. Copy the values for your Organization ID and API key. You'll need those to access your organization later.
6. Click Done and you’ll see the key in your list of API keys.

## Enable/Disable CRUD Commands
You can select which CRUD commands are enabled in the integration instance configuration settings. By default, all commands are enabled.
