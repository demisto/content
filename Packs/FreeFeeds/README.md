This pack serves as a comprehensive collection of diverse free feeds available for TIM. Each individual pack is appropriately tagged to specify if it is free, requires signup, credentials, or has other specifications. It's important to note that this pack does not contain independent content; rather, its primary purpose is to aggregate and install various optional dependency packs based on the user's choice upon installation.

These 4 new tags have been added to all the relevant feeds:
- **Plug & Fetch** - Free feed, no credentials or registration needed.
- **Free Feed** - Free to use but credentials \ signup is needed.
- **Generic Feed** - A generic integration to fetch feeds, unique to the feed type but not its vendor (TAXII, JSON, CSV etc).
- **Allow list** - (previously known as Whitelists) feeds (AWS, Azure, Cisco, Google, Cloudflare, etc.).
