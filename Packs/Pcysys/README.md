Pentera integrate the adversary perspective into an organization’s ongoing cyber defense strategy. Pentera’s Automated Security Validation platform tests, assesses, and reduces corporate cybersecurity risk so you can know where you stand at any given moment. Running remotely on the cloud or on-prem, Pentera immediately puts to action a risk-based remediation roadmap by continuously emulating real-life attacks and validating the efficacy of your defensive controls.

Together, Pentera and Cortex XSOAR enable security teams to combine both offensive security techniques and extended detection & response. The content pack provides the right intelligence to focus remediation effort on high priority vulnerabilities that would be exploited by adversaries if left unattended. Key use cases include:
- Eliminate attack surface exposure and maintain cyber hygiene with automated real-time validation for critical vulnerabilities without false positives.
- Apply the most current adversary techniques and uncover the complete attack operation while increasing SOC focus, automation, and threat hunting effectiveness.
- Leverage real-time test results and get a clear packaged summary of critical remediation steps to perform within the Cortex XSOAR War Room.
