## SysAid Integration

Included statuses returns a comma separated list of statuses you can use for fetching incidents. The default value includes "open classes".
You may add or remove statuses.
The list of statuses can be retrieved by running the ***sysaid-table-list*** command with the *list_id=status* argument.
