To connect to the Azure Active Directory Identity Protection using either the Cortex XSOAR Azure application or the Self-Deployed Azure application, do one of the following:

- **Cortex XSOAR Azure application**: Use application ID `4ffef4a4-601f-4393-a789-432f3f3b8470`, and fill in your subscription ID (from the Azure Portal).
- **Self Deployed Azure application**: Do the following:
   1. Add a new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal, with the following permissions:
   - `IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All`
   - `User.Read`
   - `IdentityRiskyUser.ReadWrite.All`, used to update user status, for example by calling the `!azure-ad-identity-protection-risky-user-confirm-compromised` command.
   2. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Subscription ID** in the Azure Portal and add it to the instance settings in Cortex XSOAR. 

Once the instance is set up, perform the following steps to log in: 
1. Run the `!azure-ad-auth-start` command.
2. Follow the instructions that appear.
3. Run the `!azure-ad-auth-complete` command.

At the end of the process, a confirmation message appears. 

**Note:** the `Test` button is not functional for instances of this integration, run the `!azure-ad-auth-test` command to test the connection.
