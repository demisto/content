## Google Gemini v1.0.2

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed unsafe dictionary access in test module error handling that could cause KeyError exceptions.
- Removed inappropriate `time.sleep()` usage and implemented proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
- Added missing `raw_response` parameter to CommandResults to include full API response data.
- Enhanced main function error handling with proper try/catch wrapper and `return_error()` usage.
- Fixed timeout parameter handling in BaseClient initialization to respect user-configured timeout settings.

### Improvements
- Enhanced error message clarity for API connectivity issues.
- Improved code reliability by using `demisto.get()` for safe dictionary access throughout the integration.
- Better adherence to XSOAR integration best practices and coding standards.

### Technical Changes
- Updated Client class to properly handle timeout configuration.
- Refactored error handling in `test_module()` function for better stability.
- Improved main execution flow with comprehensive exception handling.
