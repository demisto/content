The integration between Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR and CyberArk enables Cortex XSOAR to securely pull privileged credentials from the CyberArk Vault using CyberArk’s Secrets Manager.

This eliminates the need for Cortex XSOAR to store or embed these credentials within their solution and the need for customers to rotate these credentials within Cortex XSOAR.

The integration helps ensure that privileged credentials are secured in the Vault, rotated to meet company guidelines, and meet complexity requirements.

The CyberArk Credential Provider can be used for managing privileged credentials from both Palo Alto XSOAR and XSIAM. By doing this, XSOAR and XSIAM can securely retrieve privileged credentials from the CyberArk Vault.

<b><h3> Use Cases &amp; Benefits</h3></b>

* High performance: Meets the needs of the enterprise’s most mission critical and demanding applications.
* Strong authentication: Verifies the origin of any application requesting the credential.
* No downtime: Rotates credentials based on policy while applications keep running.
