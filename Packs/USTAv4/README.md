Since 2012, we have been pioneering one of the first cyberthreat intelligence platforms ever developed. Our CTI platformU.S.T.A. (Unified Security Threat Alliance) entails a unique synergy of five main modules: Deep Sight, Brand Protection, Fraud Intelligence, Security Intelligence, and Attack Surface Management.

## What does this pack do?

This integration pack enables seamless integration of the USTA platform with Cortex XSOAR. It automates the process of fetching and managing incidents from the USTA platform, which they are listed as below

- USTA Account Takeover Prevention
- USTA Stolen Credit Cards

In essence, this pack brings the core functionality of the USTA platform into XSOAR, enabling analysts to respond effectively to incidents without leaving the XSOAR interface.

Additionally, the pack offers integration with the USTA Threat Intelligence module for indicator enrichment. This feature retrieves enhanced information and reputation data for the following indicator types:

- URL
- File SHA-256
- File SHA-1
- File MD5
- Domain
- IPV4

## How to Use It?

To get started, simply install the pack and configure the USTA integration instances within XSOAR. During configuration, you will need an active API key, which can be generated from the USTA platform.
