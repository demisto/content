#### Integrations
##### Office 365 Feed
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.11.61265*.
- Fixed an issue where an unsuccessful fetch would complete successfully.
- In some cases, the Germany endpoints can be unavailable for some users. Now by default, we exclude Germany to prevent the fetch indicators from failing.
