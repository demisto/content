description: The Office 365 IP Address and URL web service is a read-only API provided by Microsoft to expose the URLs and IPs used by Office 365. The Office 365 Feed integration fetches indicators from the service, with which you can create a list (allow list, block list, EDL, etc.) for your SIEM or firewall service to ingest and apply to its policy rules.
