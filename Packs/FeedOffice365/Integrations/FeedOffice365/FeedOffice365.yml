description: The Office 365 IP Address and URL web service is a read-only API provided
  by Microsoft to expose the URLs and IPs used by Office 365. The Office 365 Feed
  integration fetches indicators from the service, with which you can create a list
  (allow list, block list, EDL, etc.) for your SIEM or firewall service to ingest and
  apply to its policy rules.
