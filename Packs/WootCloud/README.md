# WootCloud Pack
WootCloud’s integration with Cortex™ XSOAR allows customers to append contextualized alerts with critical intelligence to SOAR workflows so users can build and automate workflows, simplify the incident response process and reduce the amount of human intervention necessary to handle security incidents.
By automating time-intensive, manual processes and operational workflows and delivering powerful, consolidated analytics, real-time dashboards and reporting from across the security infrastructure, this integration maximizes the incident response capabilities of over-burdened and understaffed security operations.

### What does this pack do?

    • WootCloud using its HyperContext algorithms classify, correlate and surface event and threats.
    • Adds deep device fingerprinting to each event, based on network/packet details as well as traffic from Bluetooth and BLE devices.
    • WootCloud runs algorithms to correlate anomalies and events with detailed information.
    • Creates highly curated super anomalies with relevant accurate information.

    This event information can be ingested or fetched on demand and be used in building more powerful playbooks for further actions and responses. 
    It can be filtered based on severity and type for granularity.
