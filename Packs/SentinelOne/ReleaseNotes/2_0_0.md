#### Integrations
##### SentinelOne v2
- **Breaking Change** in the following commands due to changes in the SentinelOne API:
    - ***sentinelone-get-hash*** - Removed the *SentinelOne.Hash.Classification* and the *SentinelOne.Hash.Classification Source* command outputs.
    - ***sentinelone-threat-summary*** - New command outputs. This command is executable for API version 2.1 only.
    - ***sentinelone-list-agents*** and ***sentinelone-get-agent*** - Fixed a typo in the *IsDecommissioned* output.
- Added the *api_version* integration parameter to support both SentinelOne API versions *2.0* and *2.1*.
- ***sentinelone-get-agent*** - You can now provide a comma-separated list of Agent IDs to the *agent_id* argument .
- Added the following command outputs to the ***sentinelone-get-threats*** command:
    - *SentinelOne.Threat.FileSha256* which provides the SHA256 hash of file content.
    - *SentinelOne.Threat.ConfidenceLevel* which provides the SentinelOne threat confidence level.
    - *SentinelOne.Threat.ClassificationSource* which provide the source of the threat Classification.
- Fixed an issue where the ***sentinelone-get-processes*** command returned all event types rather than the process type.
- Fixed an issue where the ***sentinelone-uninstall-agent*** command was actually shutdown an agent instead of uninstall it.
- Documentation and metadata improvements.
- Updated the Docker image to *demisto/python3:3.9.1.14969*.
