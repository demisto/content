#### Integrations
##### SentinelOne v2
- Fixed an issue where the **sentinelone-disconnect-agent** and **sentinelone-connect-agent** commands would only return the first Agent ID and its network status among the IDs given as inputs.
- Added the output *SentinelOne.Agent.NetworkStatus* for the **sentinelone-connect-agent** command, which will display the network status of each agent given as input.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.96411*.
