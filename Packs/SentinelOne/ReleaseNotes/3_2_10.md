#### Integrations

##### SentinelOne v2
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.75921*.
- Fixed an issue with the Classifier where some incidents fall under the incorrect incident_type. This causes a red numbered mark on the classifier tab in XSOAR UI, which is considered as an unclassified incident.
