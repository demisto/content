#### Integrations

##### SentinelOne v2
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.10.50695*.

- Added support for the Mirroring integration. This integration allows us to mirror incidents/tickets/cases from SentinelOne. This feature is applicable for users who have Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0 and more. In order to achieve mirroring, added following:
    - Added a new field `Incident Mirroring Direction` to config.
    - Added a `Mirror SentinelOne Ticket` playbook which enables ticket mirroring with SentinelOne.
    - Added a `SentinelOne Incident Layout` which is a custom layout only for mirroring.
    - Added a `SentinelOne Incident` type.
    - Added an incoming and outgoing mapper.
