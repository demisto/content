#### Integrations
##### SentinelOne v2
- Updated the ***sentinelone-get-hash*** command to output the Hash Reputation Verdict, instead of the Hash Reputation Rank as SentinelOne has deprecated /rank API endpoint and recommend /verdict API which fetches Hash Reputation Verdict.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.89009*.
