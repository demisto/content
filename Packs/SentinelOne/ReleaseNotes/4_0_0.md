#### Integrations
##### SentinelOne v2
- Supports Mirroring Integration. This integration allows us to mirror incidents/tickets/cases from SentinelOne. This feature applicable to the users who had the Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0 and more. In order to achieve Mirroring added following things:
    - Added a new field `Incident Mirroring Direction` to config.
    - Added `Mirror SentinelOne Ticket` playbook which enables ticket mirroring with SentinelOne.
    - Added `SentinelOne Incident Layout` which is a custom layout only for the Mirroring.
    - Added `SentinelOne Incident` type.
    - Added incoming and outgoing mappers.
    - Added some custom Incident Fields.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.9.46807*.
