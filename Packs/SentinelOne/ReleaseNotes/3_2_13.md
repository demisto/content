- Added 2 commands:
    - ***sentinelone-get-accounts***
    - ***sentinelone-get-threat-notes***
- Added the *columns* argument to the commands ***sentinelone-list-agents*** and ***sentinelone-get-events***.
- Updated the description and type of the output *SentinelOne.Threat.Mitigation.Action* from the command ***sentinelone-mitigate-threat*** as they were incorrect.
