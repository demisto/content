This pack enables you to use SentinelOne for endpoint protection.
You can receive alerts from endpoints, search for processes on endpoints, block endpoints and manage the endpoint protection policy.
## What does this pack do?
This pack enables you to
- Connect, disconnect, shutdown, and uninstall agents.
- Get information about agents and agent groups, move an agent from one group to another, delete groups, and send broadcast messages to groups of agents. 
- Get information about threats, mark a suspicious behavior as a threat, and mitigate threats.
- Get information about the system sites and reactivate a site if necessary.
- Get information about activities, events and processes in the system.
The **Sentinel One - Endpoint data collection** playbook collects endpoint information by using SentinelOne commands.
The pack includes the **SentinelOne v2** integration and the **Sentinel One - Endpoint data collection** playbook.
## How does this pack work?
Create an instance of the **SentinelOne v2** integration and start fetching information from the SentinelOne database.
