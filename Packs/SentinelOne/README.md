This pack enables you to use SentinelOne for endpoint protection.
You can receive alerts from endpoints, search for processes on endpoints, block endpoints and manage the endpoint protection policy.
## What does this pack do?
This pack enables you to
- Connect, disconnect, shutdown, and uninstall agents.
