### Retrieve API Token
1. To get your API token, log in to your SentinelOne console.
2. Click on the username -> my profile -> actions (in the top right corner) -> API token operations menu -> generate api token -> enter two-factor auth code -> copy token.
3. Save your API token in a safe place because you will not be able to access it later.
