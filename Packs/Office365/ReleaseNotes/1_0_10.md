##### Office 365 Modeling Rule

- Improved implementation of the existing extractions and mappings. 
  - Added support for additional [record type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#auditlogrecordtype) values for the `xdm.event.type` mapping. 
  - Added support for extracting and mapping multiple client IP addresses.
  - Added support for handling [*IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#IPv4-mapped_IPv6_addresses) for client IP addresses.
  - Added support for extracting and mapping the source port and interface identifier when they are present in the client IP address field value. 
  - Fixed an issue with the `xdm.target.file.filename` that caused the mapped filename value to be truncated. 
  - Removed the surrounding angle brackets from the `xdm.target.resource.name` mapped value, when such existed.  
  - Updated the `xdm.event.operation` mapping to the raw `Operation` field value if it does not match to any of the existing [XDM_CONST.OPERATION_TYPE](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSIAM/Cortex-Data-Model-Schema-Guide/XDM_CONST.OPERATION_TYPE) ENUM values. 
  - Updated the `xdm.source.user.upn` mapping to the `UserId` field on first precedence. 
  - Updated the `xdm.observer.type` mapping to the `Workload` field on first precedence. 
  - Updated the mapping of the `xdm.email.subject` field on the `msft_o365_general_raw` dataset for the `Subject` field on first precedence with a fallback to the `ItemName` field only on [MIP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#mip-label-schema) events.
