| Hostname | Hostname of the machine on which the file is located. | incident.hostname | Optional |
| FilePath | The path of the file to retrieve.<br/>For example:<br/>C:\\users\\folder\\file.txt | File.Path | Optional |
| UseD2 | Specifies whether to use a D2 agent to retrieve the file. | no | Optional |
| SHA1 | The SHA1 hash value for the suspicious file. | incident.sha1 | Optional |

| ManualThreatHunting | Perform manual threat hunting.<br/>Yes- to activate.<br/> | No | Optional |
| NeedMoreForensics | Providing the value \`Yes\` will activate the \`Forensics - Generic\` playbook that retrieves additional forensics on the investigating host. <br/>Yes- to activate. | no | Optional |
| IPAddress | This input is relevant if the Threat Hunting - Generic playbook is activated. <br/>If you activated the Threat Hunting - Generic playbook and you are hunting IP addresses, provide the IP addresses here.<br/> |  | Optional |
| URLDomain | This input is relevant if the Threat Hunting - Generic playbook is activated. <br/>If you activated the Threat Hunting - Generic playbook and you are hunting for URLs or domains, provide them here.  |  | Optional |
| InternalRange | This input is relevant if the Threat Hunting - Generic playbook is activated. <br/>The input is a list of internal IP ranges to check IP addresses against. The list should be provided in CIDR notation, separated by commas. An example of a list of ranges would be: "172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16" \(without quotes\).
