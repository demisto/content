LINE API Integration is used for sending a message to LINE Group. 

Before you use this integration, you need to get a LINE Group token from your account.
1. Login to https://notify-bot.line.me/my/ with your username/password of line.
2. Click 'your name' in top-right, and select "My page"
3. Click 'Generate Token' , and then input a token name and select a chat group.
4. Then click 'Generate token', then you will see a token with you. Make sure you copy the token string and keep it.

After that, you could go back to LINE, and invite 'LINE Notify' bot into your chat group.
The bot (LINE Notify) will send/forward your message to the LINE group while you trigger it from XSOAR integration.
