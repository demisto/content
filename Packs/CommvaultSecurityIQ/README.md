Introducing Commvault Cloud integration pack for Commvault products. It enables security analysts swiftly respond to threats using pre-built integrations, playbooks to secure and audit backups and backup software ecosystem.

With today's evolving threat landscape, data is under constant risk of data destruction and exfiltration. Organizations are challenged with responding to security events as quickly as they can to limit the impact of cyber threats on their production as well as backup data. This content pack allows organizations to monitor anomaly alerts from Commvault Cloud data protection platforms, so they can respond with orchestrated actions to help fortify the data protection platform.

## Key features :

-   Support for Commvault Cloud
-   Suspicious file anomaly monitoring to indicate file encryption.
-   Fetch Commvault Cloud file anomaly alerts over API, Commvault Webhook, or Syslog
-   Native API token storage or Azure Key Vault token storage
