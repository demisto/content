### Microsoft Policy And Compliance Audit Log
This integration searches the unified audit log to view user and administrator activity in your organization.

### App authentication
To use this integration, you will need to add a new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal. 
1. To create the application, follow the instructions in this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps). 
2. Run the **CreateCertificate** script from the `EWS` pack in Cortex XSOAR to acquire the certificate. You can also provide your own certificate or perform the instructions in the following Microsoft article: [Generate a self-signed certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#step-3-generate-a-self-signed-certificate).
3. Attach the .cer file to your Azure App. See the following [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#step-4-attach-the-certificate-to-the-azure-ad-application) for an example.
4. Copy the contents of the .txt file and paste it in the Certificate parameter of the integrationâ€™s instance.
