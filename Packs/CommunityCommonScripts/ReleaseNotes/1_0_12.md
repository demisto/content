#### Scripts

##### New: FindAllIPs
This script will look for potential IPs in text when they are appended or prepended with other strings eg:
Block this IP: 192.168.1.4Thanks --> 192.168.1.4
Please remove the following IP from the EDL List10.10.10.23 Thanks --> 10.10.10.23
The logic is based on the following script: https://github.com/greaselovely/network.bits/blob/main/ip_getter.py
 (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.8.0).
