  Calculates the time span between two dates using Powershell's `New-TimeSpan` command.

  A timespan with a start date of "2022-04-02T15:42:48" and end date of "2022-04-12T16:55:07" would return the following:

  Days                          : 10
  Hours                        : 1
  Minutes                    : 12
  Seconds                   : 19
  Milliseconds           : 0
  Ticks                          : 8683390000000
  TotalDays                : 10.0502199074074
  TotalHours              : 241.205277777778
  TotalMinutes          : 14472.3166666667
  TotalSeconds         : 868339
  TotalMilliseconds : 868339000
