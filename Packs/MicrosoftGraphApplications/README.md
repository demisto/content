An application provides authorization access to your APIs. An instance of the application is a service principal. Using this integration you can retrieve a list of the service principals. If you find a service principal that has suspicious permissions, or if you see suspicious behavior of a service principal, you can remove that service principal.



## What does this pack do?
The **Azure Active Directory Applications** integration enables you to:
- Retrieve a detailed list of service principals.
- Remove a service principal from the directory.
