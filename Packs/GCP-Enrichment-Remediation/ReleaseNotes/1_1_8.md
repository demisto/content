##### GCP - Firewall Remediation

Updated the to naming standard of the firewall rules to be in the format `remediation-<block|allow>-<vpc name>-port-<port nubmer>-<tcp|udp>`, where the VPC name is truncated to 30 characters to meet the overall 63 character limit for firewall rule names.  This ensures that unique firewall names are made in each VPC that a firewall rule could be created.
