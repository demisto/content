##### GCP - Enrichment

Updated the playbook to include the new **GCPOffendingFirewallRule** script.

#### Scripts

##### New: GCPOffendingFirewallRule

New: Determine potential offending firewall rules in GCP based on port, protocol and possibly target tags (network tags).

Considerations:
At this time this automation only finds potential offending rules and not necessarily the rule that is matching traffic. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.8.0).
