This integration enables the management of certificates on Linux hosts directly from XSOAR using Ansible. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server, all you need to do is provide credentials you are ready to use the feature rich commands. This integration functions without any agents or additional software installed on the hosts by utilising SSH combined with Python.

To use this integration, configure an instance of this integration. This will associate a credential to be used to access hosts when commands are run. The commands from this integration will take the Linux host address(es) as an input, and use the saved credential associated to the instance to execute. Create separate instances if multiple credentials are required.

## Requirements
The Linux host(s) being managed requires Python >= 2.6. Different commands will use different underlying Ansible modules, and may have their own unique package requirements. Refer to the individual command documentation for further information.

## Network Requirements
By default, TCP port 22 will be used to initiate a SSH connection to the Linux host.

The connection will be initiated from the XSOAR engine/server specified in the instance settings.

## Credentials
This integration supports a number of methods of authenticating with the Linux Host:
1. Username & Password entered into the integration
2. Username & Password credential from the XSOAR credential manager
3. Username and SSH Key from the XSOAR credential manager

## Permissions
Whilst un-privileged Linux user privileges can be used, a SuperUser account is recommended as most commands will require elevated permissions to execute.

## Privilege Escalation
Ansible can use existing privilege escalation systems to allow a user to execute tasks as another. Different from the user that logged into the machine (remote user). This is done using existing privilege escalation tools, which you probably already use or have configured, like sudo, su, or doas. Unless you are remoting into the system as root (uid 0) you will need to escalate your privileges to a super user. Use the Integration parameters `Escalate Privileges`, `Privilege Escalation Method`, `Privilege Escalation User`, `Privileges Escalation Password` to configure this.


## Concurrency
This integration supports execution of commands against multiple hosts concurrently. The `host` parameter accepts a list of addresses, and will run the command in parallel as per the **Concurrency Factor** value.

## Further information
This integration is powered by Ansible 2.9. Further information can be found on that the following locations:
* [Ansible Getting Started](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html)
* [Module Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html)

## Configure Ansible OpenSSL on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Ansible OpenSSL .
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Username | The credentials to associate with the instance. SSH keys can be configured using the credential manager. | True |
    | Password |  | True |
    | Default SSH Port | The default port to use if one is not specified in the commands \`host\` argument. | True |
    | Concurrency Factor | If multiple hosts are specified in a command, how many hosts should be interacted with concurrently. | True |
    | Escalate Privileges | Ansible allows you to ‘become’ another user, different from the user that<br/>logged into the machine \(remote user\).<br/> | True |
    | Privilege Escalation Method | Which privilege escalation method should be used. | True |
    | Privilege Escalation User | Set the user you become through privilege escalation | False |
    | Privilege Escalation Password | Set the privilege escalation password. | False |

## Testing
This integration does not support testing from the integration management screen. Instead it is recommended to use the `!openssl-certificate-info` command providing an example `host` and `path` to a certificate as the command argument. This command will connect to the specified host with the configured credentials in the integration, and if successful output information about the certificate at the path.

## Complex Command Inputs
Some commands may require structured input arguments such as `lists` or `dictionary`, these can be provided in standard JSON notation wrapped in double curly braces. For example a argument called `dns_servers` that accepts a list of server IPs 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 would be entered as `dns_servers="{{ ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'] }}"`.

Other more advanced data manipulation tools such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html)/[Jinja2 filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#builtin-filters) can also be used in-line. For example to get a [random number](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#random-number-filter) between 0 and 60 you can use `{{ 60 | random }}`.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

| mode | The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.<br/>Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.<br/>As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`). | Optional |

| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional | 
| unsafe_writes | Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.<br/>By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.<br/>This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).<br/>IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| attributes | The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr` on the target system.<br/>This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr`.<br/>The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-` operators need to be included in the string. | Optional |

See the `valid_at` return value for informations on the result.<br/>Time can be specified either as relative time or as absolute timestamp.<br/>Time will always be interpreted as UTC.<br/>Valid format is `[+-]timespec \| ASN.1 TIME` where timespec can be an integer + `[w \| d \| h \| m \| s]` (e.g. `+32w1d2h`, and ASN.1 TIME (i.e. pattern `YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ`). Note that all timestamps will be treated as being in UTC. | Optional | 
| select_crypto_backend | Determines which crypto backend to use.<br/>The default choice is `auto`, which tries to use `cryptography` if available, and falls back to `pyopenssl`.<br/>If set to `pyopenssl`, will try to use the `pyOpenSSL,https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/` library.<br/>If set to `cryptography`, will try to use the `cryptography,https://cryptography.io/` library.<br/>Please note that the `pyopenssl` backend has been deprecated in Ansible 2.9, and will be removed in Ansible 2.13. From that point on, only the `cryptography` backend will be available. Possible values are: auto, cryptography, pyopenssl. Default is auto. | Optional |

#### Base Command

`openssl-csr`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| state | Whether the certificate signing request should exist or not, taking action if the state is different from what is stated. Possible values are: absent, present. Default is present. | Optional | 
| digest | The digest used when signing the certificate signing request with the private key. Default is sha256. | Optional | 
| privatekey_path | The path to the private key to use when signing the certificate signing request.<br/>Required if `state` is `present`. | Optional | 
| privatekey_passphrase | The passphrase for the private key.<br/>This is required if the private key is password protected. | Optional | 
| version | The version of the certificate signing request.<br/>The only allowed value according to `RFC 2986,https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986#section-4.1` is 1. Default is 1. | Optional | 
| force | Should the certificate signing request be forced regenerated by this ansible module. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| path | The name of the file into which the generated OpenSSL certificate signing request will be written. | Required | 
| subject | Key/value pairs that will be present in the subject name field of the certificate signing request.<br/>If you need to specify more than one value with the same key, use a list as value. | Optional | 
| country_name | The countryName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| state_or_province_name | The stateOrProvinceName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| locality_name | The localityName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| organization_name | The organizationName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| organizational_unit_name | The organizationalUnitName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| common_name | The commonName field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| email_address | The emailAddress field of the certificate signing request subject. | Optional | 
| subject_alt_name | SAN extension to attach to the certificate signing request.<br/>This can either be a 'comma separated string' or a YAML list.<br/>Values must be prefixed by their options. (i.e., `email`, `URI`, `DNS`, `RID`, `IP`, `dirName`, `otherName` and the ones specific to your CA)<br/>Note that if no SAN is specified, but a common name, the common name will be added as a SAN except if `useCommonNameForSAN` is set to `false`.<br/>More at `https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6`. | Optional | 
| subject_alt_name_critical | Should the subjectAltName extension be considered as critical. | Optional | 
| use_common_name_for_san | If set to `yes`, the module will fill the common name in for `subject_alt_name` with `DNS:` prefix if no SAN is specified. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is Yes. | Optional | 
| key_usage | This defines the purpose (e.g. encipherment, signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the certificate. | Optional | 
| key_usage_critical | Should the keyUsage extension be considered as critical. | Optional | 
| extended_key_usage | Additional restrictions (e.g. client authentication, server authentication) on the allowed purposes for which the public key may be used. | Optional | 
| extended_key_usage_critical | Should the extkeyUsage extension be considered as critical. | Optional | 
| basic_constraints | Indicates basic constraints, such as if the certificate is a CA. | Optional | 
| basic_constraints_critical | Should the basicConstraints extension be considered as critical. | Optional | 
| ocsp_must_staple | Indicates that the certificate should contain the OCSP Must Staple extension (`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633`). | Optional | 
| ocsp_must_staple_critical | Should the OCSP Must Staple extension be considered as critical<br/>Note that according to the RFC, this extension should not be marked as critical, as old clients not knowing about OCSP Must Staple are required to reject such certificates (see `https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633#section-4`). | Optional | 
| select_crypto_backend | Determines which crypto backend to use.<br/>The default choice is `auto`, which tries to use `cryptography` if available, and falls back to `pyopenssl`.<br/>If set to `pyopenssl`, will try to use the `pyOpenSSL,https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/` library.<br/>If set to `cryptography`, will try to use the `cryptography,https://cryptography.io/` library.<br/>Please note that the `pyopenssl` backend has been deprecated in Ansible 2.9, and will be removed in Ansible 2.13. From that point on, only the `cryptography` backend will be available. Possible values are: auto, cryptography, pyopenssl. Default is auto. | Optional | 
| backup | Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original CSR back if you overwrote it with a new one by accident. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| create_subject_key_identifier | Create the Subject Key Identifier from the public key.<br/>Please note that commercial CAs can ignore the value, respectively use a value of their own choice instead. Specifying this option is mostly useful for self-signed certificates or for own CAs.<br/>Note that this is only supported if the `cryptography` backend is used!. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| subject_key_identifier | The subject key identifier as a hex string, where two bytes are separated by colons.<br/>Example: `00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33`<br/>Please note that commercial CAs ignore this value, respectively use a value of their own choice. Specifying this option is mostly useful for self-signed certificates or for own CAs.<br/>Note that this option can only be used if `create_subject_key_identifier` is `no`.<br/>Note that this is only supported if the `cryptography` backend is used!. | Optional | 
| authority_key_identifier | The authority key identifier as a hex string, where two bytes are separated by colons.<br/>Example: `00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33`<br/>If specified, `authority_cert_issuer` must also be specified.<br/>Please note that commercial CAs ignore this value, respectively use a value of their own choice. Specifying this option is mostly useful for self-signed certificates or for own CAs.<br/>Note that this is only supported if the `cryptography` backend is used!<br/>The `AuthorityKeyIdentifier` will only be added if at least one of `authority_key_identifier`, `authority_cert_issuer` and `authority_cert_serial_number` is specified. | Optional | 
| authority_cert_issuer | Names that will be present in the authority cert issuer field of the certificate signing request.<br/>Values must be prefixed by their options. (i.e., `email`, `URI`, `DNS`, `RID`, `IP`, `dirName`, `otherName` and the ones specific to your CA)<br/>Example: `DNS:ca.example.org`<br/>If specified, `authority_key_identifier` must also be specified.<br/>Please note that commercial CAs ignore this value, respectively use a value of their own choice. Specifying this option is mostly useful for self-signed certificates or for own CAs.<br/>Note that this is only supported if the `cryptography` backend is used!<br/>The `AuthorityKeyIdentifier` will only be added if at least one of `authority_key_identifier`, `authority_cert_issuer` and `authority_cert_serial_number` is specified. | Optional | 
| authority_cert_serial_number | The authority cert serial number.<br/>Note that this is only supported if the `cryptography` backend is used!<br/>Please note that commercial CAs ignore this value, respectively use a value of their own choice. Specifying this option is mostly useful for self-signed certificates or for own CAs.<br/>The `AuthorityKeyIdentifier` will only be added if at least one of `authority_key_identifier`, `authority_cert_issuer` and `authority_cert_serial_number` is specified. | Optional | 
| mode | The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.<br/>Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.<br/>As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`). | Optional | 
| owner | Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| group | Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| seuser | The user part of the SELinux file context.<br/>By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| serole | The role part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional | 
| unsafe_writes | Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.<br/>By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.<br/>This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).<br/>IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| attributes | The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr` on the target system.<br/>This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr`.<br/>The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-` operators need to be included in the string. | Optional |

### openssl-dhparam
***
Generate OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Parameters
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/openssl_dhparam_module.html


#### Base Command

`openssl-dhparam`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| state | Whether the parameters should exist or not, taking action if the state is different from what is stated. Possible values are: absent, present. Default is present. | Optional | 
| size | Size (in bits) of the generated DH-params. Default is 4096. | Optional | 
| force | Should the parameters be regenerated even it it already exists. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| path | Name of the file in which the generated parameters will be saved. | Required | 
| backup | Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original DH params back if you overwrote them with new ones by accident. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| mode | The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.<br/>Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.<br/>As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`). | Optional | 
| owner | Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| group | Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| seuser | The user part of the SELinux file context.<br/>By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| serole | The role part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional | 
| unsafe_writes | Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.<br/>By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.<br/>This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).<br/>IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| attributes | The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr` on the target system.<br/>This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr`.<br/>The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-` operators need to be included in the string. | Optional | 


#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSSL.OpensslDhparam.size | number | Size \(in bits\) of the Diffie-Hellman parameters. | 
| OpenSSL.OpensslDhparam.filename | string | Path to the generated Diffie-Hellman parameters. | 
| OpenSSL.OpensslDhparam.backup_file | string | Name of backup file created. | 




### openssl-pkcs12
***
Generate OpenSSL PKCS#12 archive
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/openssl_pkcs12_module.html


#### Base Command

`openssl-pkcs12`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| action | `export` or `parse` a PKCS#12. Possible values are: export, parse. Default is export. | Optional | 
| other_certificates | List of other certificates to include. Pre 2.8 this parameter was called `ca_certificates`. | Optional | 
| certificate_path | The path to read certificates and private keys from.<br/>Must be in PEM format. | Optional | 
| force | Should the file be regenerated even if it already exists. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| friendly_name | Specifies the friendly name for the certificate and private key. | Optional | 
| iter_size | Number of times to repeat the encryption step. Default is 2048. | Optional | 
| maciter_size | Number of times to repeat the MAC step. Default is 1. | Optional | 
| passphrase | The PKCS#12 password. | Optional | 
| path | Filename to write the PKCS#12 file to. | Required | 
| privatekey_passphrase | Passphrase source to decrypt any input private keys with. | Optional | 
| privatekey_path | File to read private key from. | Optional | 
| state | Whether the file should exist or not. All parameters except `path` are ignored when state is `absent`. Possible values are: absent, present. Default is present. | Optional | 
| src | PKCS#12 file path to parse. | Optional | 
| backup | Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original output file back if you overwrote it with a new one by accident. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| mode | The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.<br/>Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.<br/>As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`). | Optional |

| seuser | The user part of the SELinux file context.<br/>By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| serole | The role part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional | 
| unsafe_writes | Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.<br/>By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.<br/>This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).<br/>IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| attributes | The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr` on the target system.<br/>This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr`.<br/>The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-` operators need to be included in the string. | Optional |

### openssl-privatekey
***
Generate OpenSSL private keys
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/openssl_privatekey_module.html


#### Base Command

`openssl-privatekey`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| state | Whether the private key should exist or not, taking action if the state is different from what is stated. Possible values are: absent, present. Default is present. | Optional | 
| size | Size (in bits) of the TLS/SSL key to generate. Default is 4096. | Optional | 
| type | The algorithm used to generate the TLS/SSL private key.<br/>Note that `ECC`, `X25519`, `X448`, `Ed25519` and `Ed448` require the `cryptography` backend. `X25519` needs cryptography 2.5 or newer, while `X448`, `Ed25519` and `Ed448` require cryptography 2.6 or newer. For `ECC`, the minimal cryptography version required depends on the `curve` option. Possible values are: DSA, ECC, Ed25519, Ed448, RSA, X25519, X448. Default is RSA. | Optional | 
| curve | Note that not all curves are supported by all versions of `cryptography`.<br/>For maximal interoperability, `secp384r1` or `secp256r1` should be used.<br/>We use the curve names as defined in the `IANA registry for TLS,https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8`. Possible values are: secp384r1, secp521r1, secp224r1, secp192r1, secp256r1, secp256k1, brainpoolP256r1, brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1, sect571k1, sect409k1, sect283k1, sect233k1, sect163k1, sect571r1, sect409r1, sect283r1, sect233r1, sect163r2. | Optional | 
| force | Should the key be regenerated even if it already exists. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| path | Name of the file in which the generated TLS/SSL private key will be written. It will have 0600 mode. | Required | 
| passphrase | The passphrase for the private key. | Optional | 
| cipher | The cipher to encrypt the private key. (Valid values can be found by running `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` or `openssl list-cipher-algorithms`, depending on your OpenSSL version.)<br/>When using the `cryptography` backend, use `auto`. | Optional | 
| select_crypto_backend | Determines which crypto backend to use.<br/>The default choice is `auto`, which tries to use `cryptography` if available, and falls back to `pyopenssl`.<br/>If set to `pyopenssl`, will try to use the `pyOpenSSL,https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/` library.<br/>If set to `cryptography`, will try to use the `cryptography,https://cryptography.io/` library.<br/>Please note that the `pyopenssl` backend has been deprecated in Ansible 2.9, and will be removed in Ansible 2.13. From that point on, only the `cryptography` backend will be available. Possible values are: auto, cryptography, pyopenssl. Default is auto. | Optional | 
| backup | Create a backup file including a timestamp so you can get the original private key back if you overwrote it with a new one by accident. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| mode | The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.<br/>Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.<br/>As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`). | Optional | 
| owner | Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| group | Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to `chown`. | Optional | 
| seuser | The user part of the SELinux file context.<br/>By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| serole | The role part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional |

| seuser | The user part of the SELinux file context.<br/>By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| serole | The role part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| setype | The type part of the SELinux file context.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the policy if available. | Optional | 
| selevel | The level part of the SELinux file context.<br/>This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.<br/>When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the policy if available. Default is s0. | Optional | 
| unsafe_writes | Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.<br/>By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.<br/>This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).<br/>IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| attributes | The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.<br/>To get supported flags look at the man page for `chattr` on the target system.<br/>This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by `lsattr`.<br/>The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-` operators need to be included in the string. | Optional |

### openssl-certificate-complete-chain
***
Complete certificate chain given a set of untrusted and root certificates
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/certificate_complete_chain_module.html


#### Base Command

`openssl-certificate-complete-chain`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| input_chain | A concatenated set of certificates in PEM format forming a chain.<br/>The module will try to complete this chain. | Required | 
| root_certificates | A list of filenames or directories.<br/>A filename is assumed to point to a file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. All certificates in this file will be added to the set of root certificates.<br/>If a directory name is given, all files in the directory and its subdirectories will be scanned and tried to be parsed as concatenated certificates in PEM format.<br/>Symbolic links will be followed. | Required | 
| intermediate_certificates | A list of filenames or directories.<br/>A filename is assumed to point to a file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. All certificates in this file will be added to the set of root certificates.<br/>If a directory name is given, all files in the directory and its subdirectories will be scanned and tried to be parsed as concatenated certificates in PEM format.<br/>Symbolic links will be followed. | Optional | 


#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSSL.CertificateCompleteChain.root | string | The root certificate in PEM format. | 
| OpenSSL.CertificateCompleteChain.chain | unknown | The chain added to the given input chain. Includes the root certificate.
Returned as a list of PEM certificates. | 
| OpenSSL.CertificateCompleteChain.complete_chain | unknown | The completed chain, including leaf, all intermediates, and root.
Returned as a list of PEM certificates. | 



### openssl-get-certificate
***
Get a certificate from a host:port
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/get_certificate_module.html


#### Base Command

`openssl-get-certificate`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| ansible-module-host | The host to get the cert for (IP is fine). | Required | 
| ca_cert | A PEM file containing one or more root certificates; if present, the cert will be validated against these root certs.<br/>Note that this only validates the certificate is signed by the chain; not that the cert is valid for the host presenting it. | Optional | 
| port | The port to connect to. | Required | 
| proxy_host | Proxy host used when get a certificate. | Optional | 
| proxy_port | Proxy port used when get a certificate. Default is 8080. | Optional | 
| timeout | The timeout in seconds. Default is 10. | Optional | 
| select_crypto_backend | Determines which crypto backend to use.<br/>The default choice is `auto`, which tries to use `cryptography` if available, and falls back to `pyopenssl`.<br/>If set to `pyopenssl`, will try to use the `pyOpenSSL,https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/` library.<br/>If set to `cryptography`, will try to use the `cryptography,https://cryptography.io/` library. Possible values are: auto, cryptography, pyopenssl. Default is auto. | Optional | 


#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.cert | string | The certificate retrieved from the port | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.expired | boolean | Boolean indicating if the cert is expired | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.extensions | unknown | Extensions applied to the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.issuer | unknown | Information about the issuer of the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.not_after | string | Expiration date of the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.not_before | string | Issue date of the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.serial_number | string | The serial number of the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.signature_algorithm | string | The algorithm used to sign the cert | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.subject | unknown | Information about the subject of the cert \(OU, CN, etc\) | 
| OpenSSL.GetCertificate.version | string | The version number of the certificate | 


### Troubleshooting
The Ansible-Runner container is not suitable for running as a non-root user.
Therefore, the Ansible integrations will fail if you follow the instructions in the Cortex XSOAR [Docker Hardening Guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Docker-Hardening-Guide). 

The `docker.run.internal.asuser` server configuration causes the software that is run inside of the Docker containers utilized by Cortex XSOAR to run as a non-root user account inside the container.

The Ansible-Runner software is required to run as root as it applies its own isolation via bwrap to the Ansible execution environment. 

This is a limitation of the Ansible-Runner software itself https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/611.

A workaround is to use the `docker.run.internal.asuser.ignore` server setting and to configure Cortex XSOAR to ignore the Ansible container image by setting the value of `demisto/ansible-runner` and afterwards running /reset_containers to reload any containers that might be running to ensure they receive the configuration.

See step 2 of this [guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Run-Docker-with-Non-Root-Internal-Users) for complete instructions.
