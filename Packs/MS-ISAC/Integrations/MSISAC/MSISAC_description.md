Prerequisites
-----------------
The MS-ISAC API site is not available to the public. The site is secured in a number of ways, including restriction of access to the site by IP and 
the use of OAuth 2.0 to implement two-factor authentication. 

In order to access the site, your organization's primary point of contact must request 
access by contacting the MS-ISAC SOC. When contacting the MS-ISAC SOC to request API access, please include the following information:
* The name and email of the direct point of contact (who the account will belong to)
Organization name
* The IP address or address range that will be connecting to the API site (your public IP)
* The names of the sensors you would like on the service (this can be ALL or a subset of your sensors)

Once your information has been verified, your IP will be whitelisted for API access. An organization and user account will be created and you will 
receive login credentials
