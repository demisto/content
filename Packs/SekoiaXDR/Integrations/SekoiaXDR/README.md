## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Sekoia XDR corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:

1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in Sekoia XDR events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in Sekoia XDR events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming and Outgoing | Changes made in Sekoia will be reflected in Cortex, and vice versa, ensuring status updates are synchronized between both systems. |

3. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding event is closed in Sekoia XDR.

4. Optional: Check the Reopen Mirrored Cortex XSOAR Incidents integration parameter to reopen the Cortex XSOAR incident when the matching Sekoia XDR alert is reopened.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Sekoia XDR.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot possible issues with the SEKOIA XDR integration, consider the following steps:

- **Debug Mode**: 
    - In your integration instance, enable the Debug option.
    - Navigate to `Settings > About > Troubleshooting > Download logs` to download the logs. Analyzing these logs can provide valuable insights into any issues.

- **Mirror Values**: 
  - To diagnose mirroring issues beyond what debug mode offers, you can inspect specific fields in the context data. Check if the following dbot fields are set:
    - **dbotMirrorInstance**: Indicates the instance managing the mirroring.
    - **dbotMirrorDirection**: Shows the direction of mirroring.
    - **dbotMirrorId**: The unique identifier for the mirroring process.
  - If these fields are not set, review the mappers to ensure that they are configured correctly.

- **dbotMirrorLastSync Field**:
  - The `dbotMirrorLastSync` field in the context data will update when the mirroring process updates an incident. 
  - You can observe these updates in the **War Room** as well, which will provide a log of the mirroring activity.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can effectively diagnose and resolve issues within the SEKOIA XDR integration.

## Best Practices

To make the most out of your SEKOIA XDR integration, consider the following best practices:

- **Mirroring Changes**: When mirroring is enabled, please allow at least 1 minute for changes to be reflected. The mirroring process runs every 1 minute, ensuring that data between SEKOIA and Cortex is kept in sync.

- **Handling Reopened Incidents**: If you have enabled the reopening option, the Cortex incident will be reopened under two specific conditions:
  - **Reopened Alert in SEKOIA**: If an alert is reopened in SEKOIA, the corresponding incident in Cortex will also be reopened. This ensures that the incident tracking is consistent across both platforms.
  - **Reopened Incident in Cortex**: If you reopen an incident directly in Cortex, you need to be cautious. After reopening the incident in Cortex, you should promptly change the status of the SEKOIA alert. Failing to do so might lead to the incident being automatically closed by the mirroring process.

By adhering to these best practices, you can ensure a smoother and more effective synchronization between SEKOIA and your incident management platform.
