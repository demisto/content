### API Key Creation

Similar to other APIs, SEKOIA's API employs an authentication mechanism that involves the use of an API key. To obtain an API key and facilitate secure access to SEKOIA's services, follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Begin by clicking on **Settings**. You can find this option at the bottom of the navigation bar.

2. **Access API Keys Section**: Within the **Workspace** section of the settings, locate and click on **API Keys**. This section allows you to manage your API keys.

3. **Create a New API Key**: Click on the **+ API Key** button to initiate the creation of a new API key. This button is usually prominent and easy to find in the API Keys section.

4. **Define Your Key**: Provide a unique name for your API key for easy identification. Additionally, input a description for the key. The description should be succinct yet informative, with a length between 10 and 100 characters.

5. **Assign Roles**: Choose one or more roles to associate with your API key. The roles determine the permissions and access level that the key will have when interacting with SEKOIA’s API.

6. **Save Your Key**: After filling out the necessary details and assigning roles, click on the **Save** button to generate your API key. Your new key is now ready for use in authenticating API requests.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly create an API key that provides secure and role-based access to SEKOIA's API, enabling seamless interaction with its suite of services.
