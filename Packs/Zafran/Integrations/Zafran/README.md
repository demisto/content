In todayâ€™s complex security landscape, resource-constrained teams struggle to efficiently mitigate exposure risks across large infrastructures. The Zafran Integration with Palo XSOAR helps you implement **Automated, High Impact Mitigations at scale**. With this integration, teams can prioritize mitigation actions, trigger playbooks with a single click, and streamline their response efforts, all from within the Palo XSOAR environment.

## Configure Zafran API on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Zafran API.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Server URL (e.g. api.zafran.io) | True |
    | API Key | True |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) | False |
    | Use system proxy settings | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
