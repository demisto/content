#### Integrations
##### McAfee ESM v2
- Fixed an issue where the *timeout* argument was not handled correctly in the **esm-search** command.
- Fixed an issue where no results returned if the *limit* was set to a product of 50 (e.g. 100) in the **esm-search** command.
- Upgraded the Docker image to demisto/python3:3.8.6.13358.
