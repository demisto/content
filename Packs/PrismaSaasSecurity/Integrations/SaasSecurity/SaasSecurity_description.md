Creating the Client ID and Client Secret
---
In the SaaS Security UI:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **External Service**.
2. Click **Add API Client**.
3. Enter a unique name for the API client.
4. Authorize the API client for the [required scopes](#required-scopes). You use these scopes in the POST request to the /oauth/token endpoint.
5. Copy the ***Client ID*** and ***Client Secret***.

***Tip***: Record your API client secret somewhere safe. For security purposes, it's only shown when you create or reset the API client. If you lose your secret, you must reset it, which removes access for any integrations that still use the previous secret.

- Incident management — Retrieve and change incident status.
- Quarantine management — Quarantine assets and restore quarantined assets.
