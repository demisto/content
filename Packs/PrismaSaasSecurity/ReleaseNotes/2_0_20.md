#### Integrations

##### SaaS Security Event Collector

- Added support to retrieve more logs in a single api request which would speed up the **fetch-events** execution.
- Changed the `max_iterations` default value to be 50 instead of 100 to avoid timeouts.
- In cases where `max_fetch` parameter is empty, it will default to 1000 to avoid timeouts.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.11.54132*.
