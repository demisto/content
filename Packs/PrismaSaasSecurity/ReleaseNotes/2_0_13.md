#### Integrations
##### SaaS Security Event Collector
- Fixed an issue where not all the events were fetched in the ***fetch-events*** command due to execution timeouts.
- Added the *max_iterations* integration parameter to allow controlling the number of events being fetched to prevent timeouts. 
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.9.45313*.
