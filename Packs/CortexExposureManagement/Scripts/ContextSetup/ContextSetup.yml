  This script simplifies how you add data to Cortex XSOAR's context. Use it to set static values or to map different values to existing context paths. Instead of a value you can enter TIMESTAMP to get the current timestamp in ISO format. For example:
  `!ContextSetup keys=ip,src,timestamp val1=${AWS.EC2.Instances.NetworkInterfaces.PrivateIpAddress} val2="AWS" val3="TIMESTAMP" context_key="key"`.
