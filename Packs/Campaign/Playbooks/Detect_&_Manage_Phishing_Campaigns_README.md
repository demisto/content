This playbook is used to find, create and manage phishing campaigns. When a number of similar phishing incidents exist in the system, the playbook can be used to do the following:
1. Find and link related incidents to the same phishing attack (a phishing campaign).
2. Search for an existing Phishing Campaign incident or create a new incident for linked Phishing incidents.
3. Link all detected phishing incidents to the Phishing Campaign incident that was found or created previously.
4. Update the Phishing Campaign incident with the latest data about the campaign, and update all related phishing incidents to indicate that they are part of the campaign.
