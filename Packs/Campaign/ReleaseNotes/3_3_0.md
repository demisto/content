##### Detect & Manage Phishing Campaigns
- Fixed a critical issue where a "perpetual lock" would occur, causing all phishing incidents to eventually time-out. The perpetual lock scenario would occur when the **AutomaticallyCloseIncidents** playbook input was set to True, because incidents were closing other incidents which were obtaining the lock, thus resulting in the lock never being released.
- Fixed an issue where phishing incidents were not added to a closed phishing campaign incident. You can now configure the behavior for incidents related to a closed campaign using the **BehaviorForClosedCampaign** playbook input.
- Changed the behavior of the *AutomaticallyCloseIncidents* playbook input. When set to True, phishing incidents that have detected a phishing campaign will close themselves instead of closing all detected incidents. As a side-effect of this change, the first few incidents, namely the number specified in the *minIncidentsForCampaign* playbook input, will remain open until their investigation is finished or until they're closed from the Phishing Campaign incident layout.
- Improved performance significantly, especially for environments with large amounts of incidents, by reducing the time spent in a locked state in each phishing incident.
