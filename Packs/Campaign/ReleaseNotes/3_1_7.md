#### Playbooks
##### Detect & Manage Phishing Campaigns
- Fixed a race-condition issue that caused the creation of multiple phishing campaigns instead of just one. To use this fix, you need to install and enable the Demisto Lock integration.
- The playbook now uses *SetPhishingCampaignDetails* instead of *SetByIncidentId* to prevent possible abuse of a privileged script.
- Improved playbook readability.
#### Layouts
##### Phishing Campaign
- The summary section has been replaced with new sections that update dynamically as incidents progress. This change improves readability and removes inaccurate information that was displayed.
- Added a section that shows the current owners of all related phishing incidents.
- The Mutual Campaign Indicators section now updates automatically when new indicators are discovered in the related phishing incidents.
