## Collect Events from Vendor

In order to use the collector, you can use one of the following options to collect events from the vendor:
 - [Broker VM](#broker-vm)

In either option, you will need to configure the vendor and product for this specific collector.
### Broker VM
You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Pro-Administrator-Guide/Configure-the-Broker-VM).\

2. Right-click, and select **Syslog Collector** -> **Configure**.
3. When configuring the Syslog Collector, set:
   - vendor as vendor<- Zscaler
