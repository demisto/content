# Check Point HEC

To set up a Check Point HEC instance, please provide the SMART API url based on your portal's region:

* US: https://smart-api-production-1-us.avanan.net
* EU: https://smart-api-production-1-eu.avanan.net
* CA: https://smart-api-production-1-ca.avanan.net

You can also use Check Point Infinity API Credentials instead of the SMART API. To do so, please provide one of the following urls based on your region:

* EU: https://cloudinfra-gw.portal.checkpoint.com
* US: https://cloudinfra-gw-us.portal.checkpoint.com
* AU: https://cloudinfra-gw.ap.portal.checkpoint.com

If you have several portals in different regions, you will need to use an instance per region

* Contact support to get your client id and client secret at [support page](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/)
* Keep your credentials secret since they give access to your data in Check Point Systems
