We recommend using the Unit42 ATOMs Feed instead. The Unit42 ATOMs Feed is more aligned with the STIX format, and includes more objects, such as Campaign, Course of Action and Relationships.

The Unit42 feed provides access to published IOCs that contain known malicious indicators. You can configure the number of indicators to be returned. The default is 10.

In order to access the Unit42 feed, you need to sign up.

1. Go to https://stix2.unit42.org/ to sign up.
2. Log in and create an API key for the service using the 'API Keys' page.
3. Click the '+' button in the table header to create a new key.
4. Use the 'copy' icon in the new key's row to copy the full key to the clipboard.
