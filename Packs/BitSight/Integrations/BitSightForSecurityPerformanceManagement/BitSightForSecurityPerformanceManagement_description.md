### Getting Started with BitSight for Security Performance Management

To get started with the integration, contact BitSight support so that your BitSight portal can be enabled to share findings with Cortext XSOAR.

API Key: BitSight customers can generate an API token to enable communication between BitSight and Cortex XSOAR. For information about generating an API token, refer to: <link>

Company GUID: Each company monitored by BitSight is identified by a unique unique identifier (Global Unique Identifier, or GUID). In addition, each subsidiary company associated with a parent company also has a GUID and is organized in a hierarchical tree structure. 

You can specify the GUID for a parent or subsidiary company in your company tree. Any issues related to that company and its child companies in the tree structure will be retrieved. You can easily find the GUID for your parent organization by executing the following command:


bitsight-get-companies-guid

First fetch Days: This integration will retrieve findings once per day. However, when running for the first time, the integration will take input from this parameter and retrieve incidents for the given number of days.
