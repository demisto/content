### Getting Started with Bitsight for Security Performance Management

To get started with the integration, contact Bitsight support so that your Bitsight portal can be enabled to share findings with Cortex.

API Key: Bitsight customers can generate an API token to enable communication between Bitsight and Cortex. Steps for generating an API token:

1) Login to Bitsight SPM at https://service.bitsighttech.com/app/spm/.
2) Click on the gear icon in top-right side.
3) In the dropdown menu, click on "Account".
4) In the "User Preferences" tab, there will be a section "API Token" to generate a new API Token.
5) Click on "Generate New Token" and use that token to authenticate the Bitsight integration in Cortex.

Companyâ€™s GUID: Each company monitored by Bitsight is identified by a unique identifier (Global Unique Identifier, or GUID). In addition, each subsidiary company associated with a parent company also has a GUID and is organized in a hierarchical tree structure.
