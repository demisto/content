#### Integrations
##### BitSight for Security Performance Management
- Removed unnecessary *Server URL* parameter.
- Removed parameter *Incident Daily Fetch time* since it restricted incident fetch to once a day at a particular time and is absolute as all versions of XSOAR above 6.0.0 enforce parameter *Incidents Fetch Interval* which can achieve the same.
- change command name ***bitsight-get-company-details*** to ***bitsight-company-details-get***.
- change command name ***bitsight-get-company-findings*** to ***bitsight-company-findings-get***.
- change command name ***bitsight-get-companies-guid*** to ***bitsight-companies-guid-get***.
