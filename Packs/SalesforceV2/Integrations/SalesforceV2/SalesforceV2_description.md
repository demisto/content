To set up **Salesforce** to work with XSOAR:
Add a new connected App in Salesforce by following the instruction [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_defining_remote_access_applications.htm).

If you already have a connected App, go to **Setup** -> **App Manager** -> choose the correct App from the list, and press **View**.
The Consumer Key / Secret is under **API (Enable OAuth Settings)**.

For detailed instructions see the Credentials walkthrough section at [XSOAR support](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/salesforce).
