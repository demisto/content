Real-Time Threat Intelligence Feeds provide data on the different stages of the domain lifecycle: from first-observed in the wild, to newly re-activated after a period of quiet. Newly Active Domains surfaces apex-level domains seen for the first time or after ten or more days of inactivity. Newly Observed Domains surfaces domains that we observe for the first time.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0.0 of FeedDomainTools.
