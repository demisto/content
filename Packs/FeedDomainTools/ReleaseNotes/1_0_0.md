##### FeedDomainTools

- Added a new integration called `FeedDomainTools` that can provide data on the different stages of the domain lifecycle: from first-observed in the wild, to newly re-activated after a period of quiet. Newly Active Domains (NAD)surfaces apex-level domains seen for the first time or after ten or more days of inactivity. Newly Observed Domains (NOD) surfaces domains that we observe for the first time.
