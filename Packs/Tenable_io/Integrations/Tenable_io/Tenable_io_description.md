## Configuration Parameters

#### Access key and Secret key
Tenable.io generates a unique set of API keys for each user account (**access key** and **secret key**). These keys allow your application to authenticate to the Tenable.io API without creating a session.
The method to generate API keys varies depending on the role assigned to your user account. Administrators can generate API keys for any user account. For more information, see Tenable.io documentation.
