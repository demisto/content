##### RSA Archer v2

- Added a new `xmlForFiltering` argument to the ***archer-search-records*** command to allow for the filtering of records using a raw XML condition element such as: "DateComparisonFilterCondition" or "TextFilterCondition".
- Added new "XML for fetch filtering" and "Fetch filtering logic operator" configuration parameters that affect which incidents are fetched.
  - The "XML for fetch filtering" configuration parameter cannot be a "DateComparisonFilterCondition" XML element since it would interfere with the existing fetch date filter.
