#### Integrations
##### RSA Archer v2
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.6.33415*.
- Added support for *extend-context* argument in the commands *archer-get-reports*, *search_options_command*, and *archer-upload-file*. Previously the *raw_response* was fully in XML format, but going forward it'll be an XML wrapped by a JSON.
