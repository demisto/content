#### Integrations
##### RSA Archer v2
- Fixed an issue where ***archer-get-valuelist*** command, regardless of whether there were any additional nested values, only returned the values at the first depth.
- Added support for nested values in ***archer-get-record*** command.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.9.45313*.
