  This script is used to simplify the process of creating a new record in Archer.
  You can add fields that you want in the record as script arguments and or in the
  code and have a newly created record easily.

  This automation is currently used for Archer application 75 (Security Incidents)
  but can be altered to any other application by entering another application Id as
  input or modifying the ApplicationId argument default value.Another option would
  be to duplicate this script and adjust it to the new application Id.

  Mandatory fields in your Archer setting should be changed to be mandatory arguments in this script.
  You can identify such fields by trying to create a new record, you would receive a response
  stating that Archer is missing a certain field.

  Please note that if you will change it to work with another application some of the argument
  defined fields might need to be changed as they belong to application 75.
