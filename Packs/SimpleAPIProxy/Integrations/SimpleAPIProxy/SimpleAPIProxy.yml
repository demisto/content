Note: If you click the test button more than once, a failure may occur mistakenly indicating that the port is already in use. (For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM) If you do not enter a Listen Port, an unused port for Simple API Proxy will automatically be generated when the instance is saved. However, if using an engine, you must enter a Listen Port."
