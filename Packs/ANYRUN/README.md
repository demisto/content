### The Challenge  

Modern SOCs are overwhelmed with incident alerts and lack
fast, reliable ways to assess and prioritize them effectively.
This leaves critical infrastructures vulnerable to attacks like
ransomware and data theft, which might slip through security gaps and cause major damage and downtime.

### ANY.RUN Content Pack for Cortex XSOAR

The Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR and ANY.RUN integration enables SOCs to automate triage, expand threat
coverage, and increase the detection rate, including hidden and missed malware.  

With the ANY.RUN content pack for Cortex XSOAR, your
organization can:

* Submit files and URLs to a secure sandbox for analysis
across Windows, Linux, and Android to streamline triage.
* Retrieve detailed reports in JSON, HTML, or IoC formats
for incident response.
* Ingest fresh threat data every 2 hours from over 15,000
organizations for threat hunting.
* Query threat details for IoCs, indicators of attack (IoAs),
and indicators of behavior (IoBs) to enrich incident
investigations.
* Automate workflows using Cortex XSOAR playbooks to
reduce manual workload.
