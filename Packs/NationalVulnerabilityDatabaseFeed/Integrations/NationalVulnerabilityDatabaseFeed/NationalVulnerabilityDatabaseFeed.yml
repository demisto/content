  ## National Vunerability Database Feed

  ### Overview
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program is a dictionary or glossary
  of vulnerabilities that have been identified for specific code bases, such as software
  applications or open libraries. A unique identifier known as the CVE ID allows stakeholders
  a common means of discussing and researching a specific, unique exploit. The Common
  Platform Enumeration (CPE) program fulfills a function similar to the CVE program
  for IT products and platforms. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) program
  combines CVE and CPE in a suite of tools to help automate vulnerability management
  and evaluate compliance with federal information technology security requirements.

  The NVD maintains the authoritative CPE dictionary, while the CVE program is maintained
  by the MITRE corporation. Both programs are sponsored by the U.S. Department of
  Homeland Security (DHS) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
  (CISA). The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is tasked with analyzing each
  CVE once it has been published to the CVE List. NVD analysts use the reference information
  provided with the CVE and any publicly available information at the time of analysis
  to associate Reference Tags, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v2.0, CVSS
  v3.1, CWE, and CPE Applicability statements.

  CVEs are typically available in the NVD within an hour of their publishing. Once
  a CVE is in the NVD, analysts can begin the analysis process. The processing time
  can vary depending on the CVE, the information available, and the quantity of CVEs
  published within a given timeframe. After analysis is provided, CVEs may be updated
  (modified). If modifications are available, the NVD publishes these updates once
  every two hours. The CPE Dictionary is updated nightly when modifications or new
  names are added.

  ### Request an API Key
  Navigate to https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
  On the API key requests page, enter data into the three fields on the requests form.
  Scroll to the bottom of the Terms of Use, and then click the check box marked “I
  agree to the Terms of Use.”
  Check the inbox of the email address provided in the steps above for an email from
  nvd-noreply@nist.gov.
  Activate and view the API Key by opening the single-use hyperlink. Store the API
  Key in a secure location as the page will no longer be available after it is closed.
  If your key is not activated within seven days, a request for a new API Key must
  be submitted.
  Each API Key is associated with a single email address. If an email address is used
  to request an additional API key, clicking the single-use hyperlink will invalidate
  the key previously associated with that email address.  The key will not be invalidated
  if the email is used to request another key, but the link is not opened. There is
  no process for retrieving a forgotten key.

  ### Rate Limits
  Requesting an API key allows for users to make a greater number of requests in a
  given time than they could otherwise. The public rate limit (without an API key)
  is 10 requests in a rolling 60 second window; the rate limit with an API key is
  100 requests in a rolling 60 second window.

Therefore, all indicators coming from these feeds are labeled new or modified.
