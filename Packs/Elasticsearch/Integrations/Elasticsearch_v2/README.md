Search for and analyze data in real time. 
 Supports version 6 and later.

## Permissions

The permissions required to use this integration depends on which operations you need to perform. The API user should have the same permissions a regular user would have in order to access the data via the UI. Following are the permissions needed for certain commands:
- **!es-eql-search/search/es-search/fetch-incidents** - If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have the *read* [index privilege](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) for the target data stream, index, or alias.
- **!get-mapping-fields** - If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have the *view_index_metadata* or *manage* [index privilege](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) for the target data stream, index, or alias.
