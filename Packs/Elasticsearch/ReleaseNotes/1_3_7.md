#### Integrations
##### Elasticsearch v2
- Fixed an issue where the ***search*** and ***es-search*** commands did not take the *timestamp_range_start* and *timestamp_range_start* arguments into account when performing the search filter.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3-tools:1.0.0.40085*.
