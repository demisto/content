# Genians
Use the Genians integration to block IP using assign tag and unassign tag.

Genians’ network sensing technology powered by Device Platform Intelligence (DPI) discovers 
and presents all detected devices’ business contextual and risk-related information along with 
their technical information without disturbing existing network infrastructure. 
The resulting intelligence enhances visibility and allows operators to detect and respond 
to any non-compliant or compromised devices in real time.

With the result of comprehensive network visibility, Genians can ensure compliance from all connected 
devices by leveraging Virtual In-Line Packet Inspection which operates at Layer 2. 
This technology has complete control over endpoint device traffic over TCP and UDP 
by eliminating the need for complex configurations and network changes.
