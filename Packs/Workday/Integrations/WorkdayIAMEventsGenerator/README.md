Generates Workday dummy test reports and events. Used for testing/dev purposes.

To use this integration for testing:
1. Create an instance - Add a listening port and mark the *Long running instance* checkbox.
2. Take the server with the listening port that has been configured in the integration settings,
and configure the **Workday_IAM** instance with this url and invoke the *fetch_incidents*.

For more information about how to configure the long running integration go to [Long Running HTTP Integrations](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/long-running-invoke).


This integration uses mock reports (simulates the real reports that are coming from Workday).
You can use the **generate-event** command to get all kinds of reports (hire, update, terminate and rehire)
