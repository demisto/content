Generates mock reports and events for Workday IAM. Use these for testing and development.

## Configure Workday_IAM_Event_Generator on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Workday_IAM_Event_Generator.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Long running instance | True |
    | Port mapping (&lt;port&gt; or &lt;host port&gt;:&lt;docker port&gt;) | True |
    | Incident type | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Create an instance

To configure a long running integration to be accessed via Cortex XSOAR Server's https endpoint perform the following:

1. Configure the long running integration to listen on a unique port
2. Add the following advanced Server parameter:
    - Name: instance.execute.external.<instance_name>
    - Value: true

    For example for an instance named edl set the following:
    Name: instance.execute.external.workday_iam_event_generator_instance_1
    Value: true
    
    **Note**: The instance name is configured via the Name parameter of the integration. 
    
You will then be able to access the long running integration via the Cortex XSOAR Server's HTTPS endpoint. The route to the integration will be available at:
https://<server_hostname>/instance/execute/<instance_name>

Use this URL to configure `Workday_IAM` integration and invoke *Fetch_incidents*
