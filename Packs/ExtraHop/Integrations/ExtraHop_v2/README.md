ExtraHop Reveal(x) for Cortex XSOAR is a network detection and response solution that provides complete visibility of network communications at enterprise scale, real-time threat detections backed by machine learning, and guided investigation workflows that simplify response.

## Configure ExtraHop Reveal(x) on Cortex XSOAR
    
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for ExtraHop Reveal(x).
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | The name of the instance. | True |
| Fetches incidents | Select to enable this instance to fetch detection events. Otherwise, select **Do not fetch**. Each API call fetches a maximum of 200 detection events. | True  |
| Classifier | Specifies the type of incident to be created for detection events ingested by this instance. | False |
| Incident type | Specifies the type of incident to be created for detection events ingested by this instance if a **Classifier** is not specified. | False |
| Mapper | Specifies how detection events ingested by this instance are mapped to Cortex XSOAR incident fields. | False |
| On Cloud | The type of ExtraHop system the integration will connect to. Select if connecting to ExtraHop Reveal(x) 360. Leave unselected if connecting to Reveal(x) Enterprise. | False |
| URL | The URL of the ExtraHop system this integration will connect to. | True |
| API Key | The API key required for authentication if connecting to ExtraHop Reveal(x) Enterprise. [The API key is generated on your ExtraHop system.](https://docs.extrahop.com/current/rest-api-guide/#generate-an-api-key) | False |

| Trust any certificate (not secure) | Specifies whether to allow connections without verifying SSL certificate's validity. | False |
| Use system proxy settings | Specifies whether to use XSOAR system proxy settings to connect to the API. | False |
| First fetch time | Specifies the beginning timestamp from which to start fetching detection events. | False |
| Incidents Fetch Interval | Specifies how often the instance fetches detection events. Because each API call fetches a maximum of 200 detection events, we recommend specifying one minute intervals to fetch all detection events. | False |
| Advanced Filter | Applies a filter to the list of detections based on a JSON-specific query.<br/><br/>Example for detections:<br/>\{<br/>  "categories": \["sec.attack"\],<br/>  "risk_score_min": 51<br/>\}<br/><br/>If the categories and category are not specified, then categories will be set to \["sec.attack"\]. The category field is deprecated by the API, so please use the categories field instead.<br/>For a complete reference to the Extrahop detections filter fields, please refer to the ExtraHop REST API documentation at<br/>https://docs.extrahop.com/current/rest-api-guide/ | False |
| Do not use by default | Select to disable running commands through the Cortex XSOAR CLI on this instance of the integration. | False |
| Log Level | Specifies the level of logging to enable for this instance of the integration. | False |
| Run on | Specifies whether to run the instance of the integration on a single engine. | False |
    
4. Click **Test** to validate the URL, credentials, and connection.
