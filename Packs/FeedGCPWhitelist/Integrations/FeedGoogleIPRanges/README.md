  This option will fetch GCP customer global and regional external IP rages from https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json.
  This should be used instead of the GCP Whitelist Feed integration.
- All available Google IP ranges:
  This option will fetch All Google IP ranges from https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/goog.json.

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
