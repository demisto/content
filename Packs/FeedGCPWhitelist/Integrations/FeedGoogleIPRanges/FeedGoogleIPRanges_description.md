### Google IP Ranges Feed
Use the Google IP Ranges Feed integration to get GCP and Google global IP ranges.

#### IP Address Ranges
The **IP Address Ranges** Parameter determines the group of IP ranges for the feed to fetch:
- All GCP customer global and regional external IP ranges: 
    This option will fetch GCP customer global and regional external IP ranges from https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json.
    This should be used instead of the GCP Whitelist Feed integration.
- All available Google IP ranges:
  This option will fetch All Google IP ranges from https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/goog.json.
