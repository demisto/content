RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.
The RSS feed keeps you up to date with new articles the site publishes.

The Feed RSS pack contains the **RSS integration** that creates a report indicator for each new article the configured RSS publishes. 
The **RSS Create Indicators From Report** playbook enables extracting and creating indicators from the article content and creating relationships between them.
