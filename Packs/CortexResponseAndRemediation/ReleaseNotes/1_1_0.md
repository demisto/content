##### This playbook addresses the following alerts:

- A user executed suspicious LDAP enumeration queries

##### Playbook Stages:

###### Triage:

- Get additional event information about the LDAP searches executed by the user
- Ensure that a single client IP exists in the alert
- Get endpoint information for the client IP
- Check preconditions for continuing investigation based on the number of suspicious attributes, attack tool queries, and vulnerable certificate templates


###### Investigation:

- Enrich the user that executed the queries
- Check if the user was created recently
- Search for additional discovery alerts in the incident
- Check user groups and roles to determine if the user is unprivileged
- Check user querying frequency to detect anomalies
- Get host risk level
- Search for recent malware alerts on client IP

###### Containment:

- With analyst approval, disable the user in Active Directory if user-related anomalies are found and the alert is a True Positive.
- With analyst approval, isolate the endpoint if host-related anomalies are found and the alert is a True Positive.
- Logoff user from client host if an active session is detected and the alert is a True Positive.
