CVE-2025-31324 is a critical zero-day vulnerability affecting the Metadata Uploader component of SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer. The vulnerability arises from missing authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious executable binaries. Exploitation of this flaw can lead to full remote code execution (RCE) on affected systems, posing a significant risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## CVE-2025-31324 - SAP NetWeaver RCE Vulnerability

##   Vulnerability Overview

- **Component Affected**: SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader  
- **Endpoint**: `/developmentserver/metadatauploader`  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-31324  
- **CVSS Score**: 10.0 (Critical)  
- **Exploitability**: Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this without user interaction  

This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files (e.g., JSP web shells), enabling remote code execution with the same privileges as the SAP application server process.

##  Playbook Triggers
- Manually
- "CVE Exploitation - 986328356" Agent rule

##  Playbook Flow
1. Using XQL, identify potential SAP NetWeaver instances in your environment.
2. Using XQL, check if there are events that point to any potential webshells downloaded in the directories.
3. Directory enumeration to identify if there are already any suspicious files that might indicate a webshell.
4. *Collect* IOCs from a Unit42 blog, *search* them using the "Threat Hunting - Generic" playbook (supports Palo Alto networks products, Qradar, and Splunk), and *block* those indicators using the "Containment Plan - Block Indicators" playbook.
5. Provides Mitigation recommendations.
