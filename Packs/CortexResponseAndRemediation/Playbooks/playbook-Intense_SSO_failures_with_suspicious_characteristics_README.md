**This playbook addresses the following alert**:
- Intense SSO failures with suspicious characteristics.

**Playbook Stages**:

**Triage**:
- Collect additional alert data.
- Retrieve IP reputation.
- Analyze identity count and IP reputation:
  - If failures involve many users and the IP is not malicious, the alert is likely a false positive and will be closed automatically.

**Investigation**:
- Identify users with successful logins.
- Check risk indicators for affected users.
- Search for related alerts.
- Analyze authentication patterns for automation.
- Retrieve Azure and Core risk scores.
- Extract security alerts linked to affected users.
- **Check for Suspicious Evidence**, including:
  - Blocked sign-ins from a malicious IP.
  - Related security incidents and high-risk IP reputation.
  - Risk detections from Azure and Core.
  - Suspicious authentication targeting admin portals (e.g., Azure Portal, Exchange Admin, Microsoft 365 Admin).
  - The number of distinct identities involved.

**Containment**:
- **Automatic Actions**:
  - If strong indicators of compromise exist, clear active user sessions.
- **Analyst Review**:
  - Findings are presented for review.
  - **If user disablement is required**, the analyst can select users to disable in Azure AD.
  - If a user is disabled, the playbook will also **clear their active sessions**.

**Requirements**:
Ensure the following integrations are configured:
- **Microsoft Graph Identity** for Conditional Access and risk scores.
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity** for authentication analysis.
- **Core** for user risk evaluation and alert correlation.
- **Threat Intelligence Integrations** for IP reputation analysis.
