This playbook addresses the following alerts:

- Unsigned and unpopular process performed injection into a commonly abused process
- Unsigned and unpopular process performed process hollowing injection
- Unsigned and unpopular process performed queue APC injection
- Unsigned and unpopular process performed injection into a sensitive process
- Unsigned and unpopular process performed injection into svchost.exe


Playbook Stages:

Triage:

- Checks the processesâ€™ reputation.
- Retrieve all alerts associated with the case for initial analysis.

Early Containment:

- Identify whether an agent prevention rule was triggered for the same process ID. If so, there is high confidence that the alert is malicious.
  - **If triggered in prevent mode**: This indicates a high-confidence verdict and the playbook proceeds with endpoint isolation.
  - **If triggered in report mode**: This also indicates a high-confidence verdict. The playbook will notify the customer, advise an update to **prevent mode** for better protection in the future, and proceed with the investigation.
  - **If no rule is triggered**: The playbook will continue with additional checks to ensure thorough assessment.

Investigation:

- Checks for a malicious process by reputation and continues to containment if found.
- Check for commonly triggered alerts that often precede process injection:
  - If found, initiate containment.
  - If not found, proceed with additional checks.
- Analyze if any alerts align with MITRE ATT&CK tactics **TA0004 (Privilege Escalation)** and **TA0005 (Defense Evasion)**:
  - If matching tactics are found, initiate containment.
  - If not, proceed with further investigation.
- Determine if the causality (parent) process is signed:
  - If signed by a trusted authority, close the alert.
  - If unsigned, escalate for manual approval for containment.

Containment:

- For alerts validated as threats, execute the following actions:
  - Terminate the causality process (CGO) if deemed malicious.
  - Quarantine the malicious process.
  - Adds the malicious process to the block list.
  - Isolate the endpoint in high-risk scenarios to prevent further compromise.
