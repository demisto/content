##### APIVoid

- Migrated to APIVoid API V2. The integration now uses V2 API endpoints.
- Deprecated the **apivoid-url-to-html** command. This command is not supported in API V2.
- Deprecated the **apivoid-threatlog** command. This command is not supported in API V2.
- Added support for **Server URL** parameter.
- Fixed an issue where scores between the 'good' and 'suspicious' thresholds resulted in a **NONE** score. Now, any detection rate below the *Suspicious Reputation (Percentage)* threshold is considered **GOOD**.
- The *Good Reputation (Percentage)* configuration parameter has been removed.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.12.6391686*.
