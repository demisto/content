description: This integration leverages the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI REST APIs to generate human-like responses to text prompts. The APIs provide access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3.5 model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.

      description: Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the lowest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note- Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. This parameter cannot be used with gpt-35-turbo.
