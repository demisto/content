Apigee is Google Cloud's native API management platform that can be used to build, manage, and secure APIs â€” for any use case, environment, or scale. Apigee offers high performance API proxies to create a consistent, reliable interface for your backend services. The proxy layer gives you granular control over security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and more for all of your services. Apigee supports REST, gRPC, SOAP, and GraphQL, providing the flexibility to implement any API architectural style.
This integration was integrated and tested with version v1 of Google Apigee.
