## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### aws-ssm-tag-add

***
Adds or overwrites one tag for the specified resource.
Tags are metadata that you can assign to the automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines.
Tags enable you to categorize the resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.
Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
For example, you could define a set of tags for the account’s managed nodes that helps you track each node’s owner and stack level, Key=Owner Value=SysAdmin.
