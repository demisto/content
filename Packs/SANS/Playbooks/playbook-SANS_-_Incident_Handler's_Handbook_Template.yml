        "The primary purpose of this phase is to limit the damage and prevent any further damage from happening.  There are several steps to this phase;

        The first step is Short-term Containment; basically the focus of this step is to limit the damage as soon as possible. Short-term containment is not intended to be a long term
        solution to the problem; it is only intended to limit the incident before it gets worse.

        The second step is System Back-Up; it is necessary before wiping and reimaging any system to take a forensic image of the affected system(s) with tools that are well known in the computer forensics community. The reason behind this is that the forensic software will capture the affected system(s) as they were during the incident and
        thereby preserving evidence in the event that the incident resulted from a criminal act or to be used for observing how the system(s) were compromised during the lessons learned phase.

        The last step before the next phase is Long-term containment, which is essentially the step where the affected systems can be temporarily fix in order to allow them to continue to be used in production, if necessary, while rebuilding clean systems in the next phase."

      description: "\"The purpose of this phase is to complete any documentation that
        was not done during the incident, as well as any additional documentation
        that may be beneficial in future incidents. \nThe document should also be
        written in a form of a report to provide a play-by-play review of the entire
        incident; this report should be able to answer the: Who, What, Where, Why,
        and How questions that may come up during the lessons learned meeting. \nThe
        overall goal is to learn from the incidents that occurred within an organization
        to improve the team’s performance and provide reference materials in the event
        of a\nsimilar incident. \nThe lessons learned meeting should be performed
        as soon as possible\""
