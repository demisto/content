This playbook investigates a "Brute Force" incident by gathering user and IP information, and calculating the incident severity based on the gathered information and information received from the user. It then performs remediation.
This is done based on the phases for handling an incident as they are described in the SANS Institute â€˜Incident Handlerâ€™s Handbookâ€™ by Patrick Kral.

https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/incident-handlers-handbook-33901

The playbook handles the following use-cases:

* Brute Force IP Detected - A detection of source IPs that are exceeding a high threshold of rejected and/or invalid logins. 
* Brute Force Increase Percentage - A detection of large increase percentages in various brute force statistics over different periods of time.
* Brute Force Potentially Compromised Accounts - A detection of accounts that have shown high amount of failed logins with one successful login.

Used Sub-playbooks:
- IP Enrichment - Generic v2
- Account Enrichment - Generic v2.1
- Calculate Severity - Critical Assets v2
- Isolate Endpoint - Generic
- Block Indicators - Generic v2
- SANS - Lessons Learned

| device-group | Device group for the Custom URL Category \(Panorama instances\). |  |  | Optional |
| categories | The list of categories. Relevant from PAN\-OS v9.x. |  |  | Optional |
| EDLServerIP | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall External Dynamic Lists are used:
\* The IP address of the web server on which the files are stored.
\* The web server IP address is configured in the integration instance. |  |  | Optional |
| DataCollection | Use a data collection task to answer lessons learned questions based on SANS. Specify &\#x27;True&\#x27; to automatically send the communication task, and &\#x27;False&\#x27;  to prevent it. |  |  | Optional |

### Extra Information
---
Through the remediation process, the playbook checks whether one of the attempted logins was successful. If so, it raises the incident severity, which also affects the decision whether to isolate the destination endpoint. 
This check is done through the 'Successful Login' incident field which is associated to the 'Brute Force' incident type. As part of the mapping process and for the playbook to complete the logic, users should map this field value to be 'True' if a successful login occurred, and to 'False' if it hasn't.
