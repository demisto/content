#### Integrations

##### Microsoft Graph Security

- Updated the Microsoft Graph integration to include the **include-unknown-enum-members** header when fetching incidents, ensuring that unknown enum values are correctly mapped to their respective service resources. The unknown enums can be mapped to the next service resources: microsoftDefenderForCloud, microsoftSentinel, and microsoftThreatIntelligence.
