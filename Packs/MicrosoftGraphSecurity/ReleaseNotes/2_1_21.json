{"breakingChanges":true, "breakingChangesNotes": "Added the **MS graph security version** integration param, this param will decide the version of the api to use. Note: the default version is Alerts v2 which causes breaking changes and demands reconfiguring with new credentials. Also, added the **limit** and **page_size** arguments with default values to ***msg-search-alerts*** command which may causes fewer alerts to be found, feel free to increase them according to your needs."}
