Critical RCE Vulnerability: log4j - CVE-2021-44228

On Dec. 9, 2021, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache log4j 2 was identified being exploited in the wild. Public proof of concept (PoC) code was released and subsequent investigation revealed that exploitation was incredibly easy to perform. 

On Dec. 14 2021, another vulnerability was discovered related to the log4j 0-day exploit known as CVE-2021-45046.

On Dec 18 2021, yet another vulnerability was discovered related to the log4j 0-day exploit known as CVE-2021-45105 that allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0 and 2.12.3.

On Dec 28 2021, another RCE vulnerability was published for Apache Log4j2, versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4).
In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.

**Affected Version**

Apache Log4j 2.x <= 2.17.0
