Critical RCE Vulnerability: log4j - CVE-2021-44228

On Dec. 9, 2021, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache log4j 2 was identified being exploited in the wild. Public proof of concept (PoC) code was released and subsequent investigation revealed that exploitation was incredibly easy to perform. 

On Dec. 14 2021, another vulnerability was discovered related the log4j 0-day exploit known as CVE-2021-45046.

**Affected Version**

Apache Log4j 2.x <= 2.15.0-rc1

**The playbook includes the following tasks:**

* Collecting Indicators - related known indicators from several sources.
* Investigation and Hunting - indicators and exploitation patterns hunting using PAN-OS, Cortex XDR and SIEM products.
* Remediation - Blocking indicators automatically or manually based on **playbook inputs**.
* Mitigations:
    * Apache official CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046 patch.
    * Unit42 recommended mitigations.
    * Detection rules for.
        * Snort
        * Suricata
        * Sigma
        * Yara

**How to Use The Playbook**
1. Create a new incident with the incident type "Rapid Breach Response" and choose the "CVE-2021-44228 - Log4j RCE" playbook.
    1. The playbook can be configured as a job as newer indicators might be pulled in. Just create a new job with the incident type and playbook mentioned above.
2. Look and change the playbook inputs. For example, 
    1. To run the shell scripts on XDR endpoints - you will need to change "XDRScriptExecution" and the "XDREndpointIDs" playbook inputs. Note that running the scripts on **all** XDR connected linux endpoints might impact performance on the XDR (depending on number of endpoints).
    2. Change the SIEM search time frame as requested (default is 1 day). If you are using Splunk , you can change the index by changing the "SplunkSourcetype" playbook input.
    3. To block indicators automatically - change the playbook input "BlockIndicatorsAutomatically" to "True".
3. (Optional) Edit the playbook, if needed:
    1. If multiple panorama instances enabled, you will need to make sure you edit the playbook to select the instance that is the PanOS instance and not FW. 
    2. Edit the SIEM queries for your needs, fields and the organization best practices.
