description: Flashpoint Ignite Feed V2 Integration allows importing indicators of compromise using the V2 API that provides a more concise, context-rich response structure. It includes sightings of IOCs over time and IOC relationships, providing visibility into an IOC's evolution. The indicators of compromise are ingested into Cortex XSOAR and displayed in the War Room.
