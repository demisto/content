##### Command-Line Analysis

- The sub-playbook "New: Compare Process Execution Arguments To LOLBAS Patterns" has been added. This sub-playbook checks if a given process exists in the LOLBAS repository. If it does, the playbook proceeds to compare the incident's command line against known patterns of malicious commands listed in LOLBAS. The results will be added to the "CommandlineVerdict" output and will influence the overall verdict.
