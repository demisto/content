#### Playbooks

##### Search For Hash In Sandbox - Generic

- Added the *'Set Detected Hashes'* tasks to inspect each of the integrations retrieved results and store the detected file hashes under the *'DetectedHashes'* context key.


- Fixed an issue where the *'NonFoundHashes'* playbook output incorrectly included file hashes that had in fact been detected by integrations. It was resolved by merging all three *'Set non-found hashes'* tasks into one that examines all retrieved results before storing any hash in the *'NonFoundHashes'* context key.


- Removed the unnecessary *'Were all hashes found?'* conditional task as the newly added *'Set Non-Found Hashes'* tasks eliminate the need to save non-found hashes of each integration.


- Added a new playbook output titled *'DetectedHashes'* that lists all file hashes that were detected by the sandboxes.
