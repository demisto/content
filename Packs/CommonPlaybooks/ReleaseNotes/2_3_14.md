#### Playbooks
##### Threat Hunting - Generic
- Replaced the **Microsoft 365 Defender - Emails Indicators Hunt** playbook with the new **Microsoft 365 Defender - Threat Hunting Generic** playbook. The new playbook contains the replaced playbook with another new playbook for getting URL click events. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0)
- Removed the `Hostname` playbook input since it is not being used.
- Fixed an issue where the `TimeFrame` playbook input in the **QRadar Indicator Hunting V2** sub-playbook wasn't set with the correct value.
