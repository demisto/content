#### Playbooks
##### New: Block IP - Generic v3
- This playbook blocks malicious IPs using all integrations that are enabled. The direction of the traffic that will be blocked is determined by the XSOAR user (and set by default to outgoing).
Note the following:
- Some of those integrations require specific parameters to run, which are based on the playbook inputs. Also, certain integrations use FW rules or appended network objects.
- The appended network objects should be specified in the blocking rules inside the system later on. 


Supported integrations for this playbook [Network security products such as FW/WAF/IPS/Etc]: 

* Check Point Firewall
* Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
* Zscaler
* FortiGate
* Aria Packet Intelligence
* Cisco Firepower 
* Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics

 (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
