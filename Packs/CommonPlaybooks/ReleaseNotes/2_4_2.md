#### Playbooks

##### Entity Enrichment - Generic v3

- Fixed an issue where risky users and hosts were not outputted from the Entity Enrichment playbook.
- Added the **URLSSLVerification** input to allow control over whether to verify SSL certificates for URLs from within the Entity Enrichment playbook inputs.
##### Endpoint Enrichment - Generic v2.1

Fixed an issue that caused all risky hosts to be outputted, instead of only the risk context of the endpoint being enriched.
