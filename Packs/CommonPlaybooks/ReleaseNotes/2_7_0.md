##### Extract Indicators From File - Generic v2

- Fixed an issue where certain PDF files would result in incorrect paths taken by the playbook.
- Improved handling of unreadable, encrypted or invalid PDFs in the playbook. Unreadable PDFs will no longer cause errors in the playbook, but will be skipped from the PDF extraction flow.
- Fixed an issue where the filters were not consistent across the condition and extraction tasks in the PDF file extraction flow, which could result in unexpected extractions.
