- The integration requires both the Sophos Central API client ID and secret.
- Client ID and secret can be found in the Sophos Central global settings.
- If these credentials are of partner or organization level, a valid tenant ID belonging to partner or organization is also required.
- The region is automatically configured based on the given credentials if credentials are of tenant level. Hence tenant ID is not required in this case.
- If a user has access to the API keys, he will have access to all of the integration commands.
