## Overview

Team Cymru's Scout integration with Palo Alto XSOAR helps streamline incident triage and accelerate threat response by providing domain and threat intelligence data.
This integration was integrated and tested with API of Team Cymru Scout.

### Key Features

- Leverage communication data to identify correlations between IP addresses, identify compromised hosts, and uncover other indications of an attack.
- Access a quick summary of NetFlow communications, Whois information, PDNS, X509 certificates, and fingerprinting details.
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address queries.
- Provides real-time threat intelligence and helps in identifying and mitigating potential security threats.
- Offers extensive documentation and support resources to assist with setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites for configuring integration instance

- Access to the [Team Cymru Scout platform](https://scout.cymru.com/scout).
- An API Key or Basic Auth credentials for authentication.

### Generate API Keys

If you prefer to use an API key for authentication, you can generate one as follows:

1. Go to the [API Keys page](https://scout.cymru.com/api_keys).
2. Click on the "Create" button.
3. Provide the description for the key, if needed.
4. Click on the "Create Key" button to generate the API key.

Note:

- The number of API keys allowed for each organization is equal to the number of user seats. Therefore, an individual user may have multiple keys, but all the users in your organization may have a maximum of 5 keys. The [API Keys page](https://scout.cymru.com/api_keys) shows the total number of keys used by your organization.
- If the "Create" button is disabled, it indicates that you have reached the maximum number of keys allowed for your organization. To generate a new key, you need to:
  - Click on the "Revoke" button next to an old key.
  - Click on the "Create Key" button to start generating a new key.
