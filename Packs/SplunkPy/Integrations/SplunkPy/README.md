## Splunk Enterprise Security Users

**Note:** The following information is for Splunk Enterprise Security Users.  
For Splunk non-Enterprise Security Users, see [Splunk non-Enterprise Security Users](#splunk-non-enterprise-security-users).

### Fetching notable events
The integration allows for fetching Splunk notable events using a default query. The query can be changed and modified to support different Splunk use cases. (See [Existing users](#existing-users)).

### Enriching notable events
This integration allows 3 types of enrichments for fetched notables: Drilldown, Asset, and Identity.

#### Enrichment types
1. **Drilldown search enrichment**: fetches the drilldown search configured by the user in the rule name that triggered the notable event and performs this search. The results are stored in the context of the incident under the **Drilldown** field.
2. **Asset search enrichment**: Runs the following query:
*| inputlookup append=T asset_lookup_by_str where asset=$ASSETS_VALUE | inputlookup append=t asset_lookup_by_cidr where asset=$ASSETS_VALUE | rename _key as asset_id | stats values(*) as * by asset_id*
where the **$ASSETS_VALUE** is replaced with the **src**, **dest**, **src_ip** and **dst_ip** from the fetched notable. The results are stored in the context of the incident under the **Asset** field.
3. **Identity search enrichment**: Runs the following query
*`| inputlookup identity_lookup_expanded where identity=$IDENTITY_VALUE*
where the **$IDENTITY_VALUE** is replaced with the **user** and **src_user** from the fetched notable event. The results are stored in the context of the incident under the **Identity** field.

#### How to configure
1. Configure the integration to fetch incidents.
2. *Enrichment Types*: Select the enrichment types you want to enrich each fetched notable with. If none are selected, the integration will fetch notables as usual (without enrichment).
3. *Fetch events query*: The query for fetching events. The default query is for fetching notable events. You can edit this query to fetch other types of events. Note that to fetch notable events, make sure the query uses the \`notable\` macro.  
4. *Enrichment Timeout (Minutes)*:  The timeout for each enrichment (default is 5min). When the selected timeout was reached, notable events that were not enriched will be saved without the enrichment.
5. *Number of Events Per Enrichment Type*: The maximal amount of events to fetch per enrichment type (default to 20).

#### Configure User Mapping between Splunk and Cortex XSOAR  
When fetching incidents from Splunk to Cortex XSOAR and when mirroring incidents between Splunk and Cortex XSOAR, the Splunk Owner Name (user) associated with an incident needs to be mapped to the relevant Cortex XSOAR Owner Name (user).  
You can use Splunk to define a user lookup table and then configure the SplunkPy integration instance to enable the user mapping. Alternatively, you can map the users with a script or a transformer.  

**note:** Owner field in Cortex XSOAR incident can only be uses for mirroring-out and cannot be changed according to Splunk values. Mirroring-in will be available via the *Assigned User* incident field. 

**Configure User Mapping Using Splunk**  
1. Define the lookup table in Splunk.  
   1. Under **App: Lookup Editor**, select **Lookup Editor**.  

      ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/091b2154a54c6208428b84f2969836c71a36bafe/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/splunk-lookup-editor.png)  

   2. Select **Create a New Lookup** > **KV Store lookup**.  

      ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/5d64d0aa825b56327759c5c6ec1b81b1d9dcf493/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/kv-store-lookup.png)  

   3. Enter the **Name** for the table. For example, **splunk_xsoar_users** is the default lookup table name defined in the SplunkPy integration settings.
   4. Under **App**, select **Enterprise Security**.
   5. Assign two **Key-value collection schema** fields, one for the Cortex XSOAR usernames and one for the corresponding Splunk usernames. For example, **xsoar_user** and **splunk_user** are the default field values defined in the SplunkPy integration settings.
   6. Click **Create Lookup**. 

      ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/ab6faddf6146cab19d13a8f3211b49ba70b166a7/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/new-lookup-table.png) 
       
     **Note:**  
    If the user keys are defined already in another table, you can use that table name and relevant key names in the SplunkPy integration settings.
    7. Add values to the table to map Cortex XSOAR users to the Splunk users.  

      ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/79c67e22ea19619f3278b2956eb41375c4d77f3f/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/add-values-to-lookup-table.png)
2. Configure the Splunk integration instance.  
Define the lookup table in Splunk.  
   1. Under **Settings** > **Integrations**, search for the SplunkPy integration and create an instance.
   2. In the Integration Settings:  
       1. Select **Enable user mapping**. 
       2. Set **Users Lookup table name** to the name of the lookup table defined in Splunk. By default it is **splunk_xsoar_users**.
       3. Set the **XSOAR user key**  to the field defined in the Splunk lookup table. By default it is **xsoar_user**.
       4. Set the **SPLUNK user key** to the field defined in the Splunk lookup table. By default it is **splunk_user**. 

          ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/9a41b8c19df9d5fd8120471bfde111de31caf033/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/user-mapping-settings-configuration.png)
   

#### Troubleshooting enrichment status
Each enriched incident contains the following fields in the incident context:
- **successful_drilldown_enrichment**: whether the drill down enrichment was successful.
- **successful_asset_enrichment**: whether the asset enrichment was successful.
- **successful_identity_enrichment**: whether the identity enrichment was successful.

#### Resetting the enriching fetch mechanism
Run the ***splunk-reset-enriching-fetch-mechanism*** command and the mechanism will be reset to the initial configuration. (No need to use the **Last Run** button).

#### Limitations
- As the enrichment process is asynchronous, fetching enriched incidents takes longer. The integration was tested with 20+ notables simultaneously that were fetched and enriched after approximately ~4min.
- If you wish to configure a mapper, wait for the integration to perform the first fetch successfully. This is to make the fetch mechanism logic stable.
- The drilldown search, does not support Splunk's advanced syntax. For example: Splunk filters (**|s**, **|h**, etc.)  

### Incident Mirroring
**Important Notes*** 
 - This feature is available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0.
 - This feature is supported by Splunk Enterprise Security only.
 - In order for the mirroring to work, the *Incident Mirroring Direction* parameter needs to be set before the incident is fetched.
 - In order to ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Splunk. 
 - For mirroring the *owner* field, the usernames need to be transformed to the corresponding in Cortex XSOAR and Splunk.
 
You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Splunk notables.
To set up mirroring:
1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for SplunkPy and select your integration instance.
3. Enable **Fetches incidents**.
4. You can go to the *Fetch notable events ES enrichment query* parameter and select the query to fetch the notables from Splunk. Make sure to provide a query which uses the \`notable\` macro, See the default query as an example.
4. In the *Incident Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:
    - Incoming - Any changes in Splunk notables (notable's status, status_label, urgency, comments, and owner) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents.
    - Outgoing - Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents (notable's status (not status_label), urgency, comments, and owner) will be reflected in Splunk notables.
    - Incoming And Outgoing - Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and Splunk notables will be reflected in both directions.
    - None - Turns off incident mirroring.
5. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored Cortex XSOAR Incidents (Incoming Mirroring)* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding notable is closed on the Splunk side.
   By default, only Notables closed with a "Closed" label will be mirrored. You can specify specific statuses (comma-separated) in the *Additional Splunk status labels to close on mirror (Incoming Mirroring)*, and enable the *Enable Splunk statuses marked as "End Status" to close on mirror (Incoming Mirroring)* option to add statuses marked as "End Status" in Splunk, and to add additional statuses to the mirroring process.
6. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored Splunk Notable Event* integration parameter to close the Splunk notable when the corresponding Cortex XSOAR incident is closed.
7. Fill in the **timezone** integration parameter with the timezone the Splunk server is using.
Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction.
**Note: This will not affect existing incidents.**

### Existing users
**NOTE: The enrichment and mirroring mechanisms use a new default fetch query.** 
This implies that new fetched events might have a slightly different structure than old events fetched so far.
Users who wish to enrich or mirror fetched notables and have already used the integration in the past:
1. Might have to slightly change the existing logic for some of their custom entities configured for Splunk (Playbooks, Mappers, Pre-Processing Rules, Scripts, Classifiers, etc.) in order for them to work with the modified structure of the fetched events. 
2. Will need to change the *Fetch events query* integration parameter to the following query (or a fetch query of their own that uses the \`notable\` macro): 

```
search `notable` | eval rule_name=if(isnull(rule_name),source,rule_name) | eval rule_title=if(isnull(rule_title),rule_name,rule_title) | `get_urgency` | `risk_correlation` | eval rule_description=if(isnull(rule_description),source,rule_description) | eval security_domain=if(isnull(security_domain),source,security_domain) | expandtoken
```

### Mapping fetched incidents using Select Schema
This integration supports the *Select Schema* feature of XSOAR 6.0 by providing the ***get-mapping-fields*** command. 
When creating a new field mapping for fetched incidents, the *Pull Instances* option retrieves current alerts which can be clicked to visually map fields.
The *Select Schema* option retrieves possible objects, even if they are not the next objects to be fetched, or have not been triggered in the past 24 hours. 
This enables you to map fields for an incident without having to generate a new alert or incident just for the sake of mapping.
The ***get-mapping-fields*** command can be executed in the Playground to test and review the list of sample objects that are returned under the current configuration.

To use this feature, you must set several integration instance parameters:
 - *Fetch events query* - The query used for fetching new incidents. *Select Schema* will run a modified version of this query to get the object samples, so it is important to have the correct query here. 
 - *Event Type Field* - The name of the field that contains the type of the event or alert. The default value is *source* which for *Notable Events* will contains the rule name. However, you may choose any custom field that suits this purpose.
 - *First fetch timestamp* - The time scope of objects to be pulled. You may choose to go back further in time to include samples for alert types that haven't triggered recently - so long as your Splunk server can handle the more intensive Search Job involved.

### Mapping Splunk CIM fields using Select Schema
This integration supports the *Select Schema* feature of XSOAR 6.0 by providing the ***get-mapping-fields*** command. 
When creating a new field mapping for fetched incidents, the *Pull Instances* option retrieves current alerts which can be clicked to visually map fields.
If the user has configured the *Use CIM Schemas for Mapping* parameter then the *Select Schema* option retrieves fields based on Splunk CIM.
For more information see: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/4.18.0/User/Overview.
The CIM mapping fields implemented in this integration are of 4.18.0 version.



## Splunk non-Enterprise Security Users

### Configure Splunk to Produce Alerts for SplunkPy for non-ES Splunk Users

It is recommended that Splunk is configured to produce basic alerts that the SplunkPy integration can ingest, by creating a summary index in which alerts are stored. The SplunkPy integration can then query that index for incident ingestion. It is not recommended to use the Cortex XSOAR application with Splunk for routine event consumption because this method is not able to be monitored and is not scalable.

1. Create a summary index in Splunk. For more information, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Indexer/Setupmultipleindexes#Create_events_indexes_2).
2. Build a query to return relevant alerts.
![image](./../../doc_files/build-query.png)
3. Identify the fields list from the Splunk query and save it to a local file.
![image](./../../doc_files/identify-fields-list.png)
4. Define a search macro to capture the fields list that you saved locally. For more information, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Knowledge/Definesearchmacros).
Use the following naming convention: (demisto_fields_{type}).
![image](./../../doc_files/micro-name.png)
![image](./../../doc_files/macro.png)
5. Define a scheduled search, the results of which are stored in the summary index. For more information about scheduling searches, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Knowledge/Definesearchmacros). 
![image](./../../doc_files/scheduled-search.png)
6. In the Summary indexing section, select the summary index, and enter the {key:value} pair for Cortex XSOAR classification.
![image](./../../doc_files/summary-index.png)
7. Configure the incident type in Cortex XSOAR by navigating to __Settings > Advanced > Incident Types.__ Note: In the example, Splunk Generic is a custom incident type.
![image](./../../doc_files/incident_type.png)
8. Configure the classification. Make sure that your non ES incident fields are associated with your custom incident type.
   1. Navigate to __Settings > Integrations > Classification & Mapping__.
   1. Click your classifier.
   2. Select your instance.
   3. Click the fetched data.
   4. Drag the value to the appropriate incident type.
![image](./../../doc_files/classify.png)
9. Configure the mapping. Make sure to map your non ES fields accordingly and make sure that these incident fields are associated with their custom incident type.
   1. Navigate to __Settings > Integrations > Classification & Mapping__.
   1. Click your mapper.
   2. Select your instance.
   3. Click the __Choose data path__ link for the field you want to map.
   4. Click the data from the Splunk fields to map it to Cortex XSOAR.
![image](./../../doc_files/mapping.png)
10. (Optional) Create custom fields.
11. Build a playbook and assign it as the default for this incident type.

### Constraints
The following features are not supported in non-ES (Enterprise Security) Splunk.
- Incident Mirroring
- Enrichment.
- Content in the Splunk content pack (such as mappers, layout, playbooks, incident fields, and the incident type). Therefore, you will need to create your own content. See the [Cortex XSOAR Administrator’s Guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/p/XSOAR) for information.

## Create KV Store
KV Store stores your data as key-value pairs in collections.  It provides a way to save and retrieve data within your Splunk apps. The following is an example for how to create a KV Store.

1. In Cortex XSOAR, create a new KV Store.
   
   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-create kv_store_name="\<kv_store_name\>"**
   
   For example:
   
   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-create kv_store_name=”test_kvstore”**
   
3. Define the fields and their type in the KV Store.

   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-config kv_store_collection_name="\<kv_store_name\>" kv_store_fields="field.\<field-name\>=\<type\>,index.\<index-name\>=\<type\>,field.\<field-name-or-index\>=\<type\>,..."**

   For example:
   
   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-config kv_store_collection_name="test_kvstore" kv_stre_fields="field.src=cidr,field.t=number,field.description=string"**

   **Note:** To see the fields in Splunk, you must install the _Splunk App for Lookup File Editing_ app in Splunk. For more information, see [Define a KV Store lookup in Splunk](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.1.0/Knowledge/DefineaKVStorelookupinSplunkWeb#:~:text=Splunk%20Web%20currently,Editing%20on%20Splunkbase).

4. Make the KV Store usable in Splunk queries.

   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-create-transform kv_store_collection_name=\<kv-store-name\> supported_fields=\<field-name-or-index\>,\<field-name-or-index\>,\<field-name-or-index\>,...**

   For example:
   
   **!splunk-kv-store-collection-create-transform kv_store_collection_name=\<test_kvstore\> supported_fields=src,t,description**

   **Note:** If no value is specified, the KV Store collection configuration will be used.

### Add data to the KV Store

To add data to the fields in the KV Store, run the following command:

**!splunk-kv-store-collection-add-entries kv_store_data="{\"\<field-name-or-index\>\": \"\<value\>\", \"\<field-name-or-index\>\": \"\<value\>\", \"\<field-name-or-index\>\": \"\<value\>\"...}"**

For example:

**!splunk-kv-store-collection-add-entries kv_store_data="{\"src\": \"88.88.88.88\", \"t\": 9, \"description\": This is the description\"}"**



## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### Get results
***
Returns the results of a previous Splunk search. This command can be used in conjunction with the `splunk-job-create` command.

##### Base Command

`splunk-results`

##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sid | The ID of the search for which to return results. | Required | 
| limit | The maximum number of returned results per search. To retrieve all results, enter "0" (not recommended). | Optional | 


##### Context Output

There is no context output for this command.

##### Command Example
``` !splunk-results sid="1566221331.1186" limit="200" ```

### Search for events
***
Searches Splunk for events. For human readable output, the table command is supported in the query argument. For example, `query=" * | table field1 field2 field3"` will generate a table with field1, field2, and field3 as headers.


##### Base Command

`splunk-search`

##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| query | The Splunk search language string to execute. For example, "index=* \| head 3". | Required | 
| earliest_time | Specifies the earliest time in the time range to search. The time string can be a UTC time (with fractional seconds), a relative time specifier (to now), or a formatted time string. The default is 1 week ago, in the format "-7d". You can also specify time in the format: 2014-06-19T12:00:00.000-07:00. | Optional | 
| latest_time | Specifies the latest time in the time range to search. The time string can be a UTC time (with fractional seconds), a relative time specifier (to now), or a formatted time string. For example: "2014-06-19T12:00:00.000-07:00" or "-3d" (for 3 days ago). | Optional | 
| event_limit | The maximum number of events to return. The default is 100. If "0" is selected, all results are returned. | Optional | 
| app | The string that contains the application namespace in which to restrict searches. | Optional|
| batch_limit | The maximum number of returned results to process at a time. For example, if 100 results are returned, and you specify a `batch_limit` of 10, the results will be processed 10 at a time over 10 iterations. This does not affect the search or the context and outputs returned. In some cases, specifying a `batch_size` enhances search performance. If you think that the search execution is suboptimal, it is  recommended to try several `batch_size` values to determine which works best for your search. The default is 25,000. | Optional |	
| update_context | Determines whether the results will be entered into the context. | Optional |
| polling | Use XSOAR built-in polling to retrieve the result when it's ready. | Optional |
