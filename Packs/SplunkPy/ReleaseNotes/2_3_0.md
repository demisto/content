#### Integrations
##### SplunkPy
- This integration version is now aligned to version 1.0.4 of the **SplunkPyPreRelease** pack, which introduced a major change to the *fetch incidents* mechanism.
- Added *Fetch backwards window* parameter to define the minimum time range to fetch. 
- Added *Unique ID fields* parameter to define a list of fields the integration will consider when looking for duplicate events.
