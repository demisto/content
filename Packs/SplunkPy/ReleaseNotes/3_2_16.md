#### Integrations

##### SplunkPy

- Fixed an issue that prevented incidents from being closed in XSOAR when a notable was closed in Splunk while using *mirror-in* functionality.
- Improved mirroring reliability by subtracting 60 seconds from the last update timestamp to account for indexing delays.
