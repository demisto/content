##### SplunkPy

- Added support for **Advanced: Time type to use when fetching events** parameter that defines which timestamp will be used to filter the events:
 *creation time*: filters based on when the event actually occurred (current behavior).
 *index time (beta)*: *beta feature* – filters based on when the event was ingested into splunk.  
  this option is still in testing and may not behave as expected in all scenarios.  
  when using this mode, you can set the parameter `fetch backwards window for the events occurrence time (minutes)` to `0`, since indexing time ensures no delaybased gaps.
