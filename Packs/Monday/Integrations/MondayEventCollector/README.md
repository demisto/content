Collects Monday.com audit logs and activity events for Cortex XSIAM.

## Required Permissions

To use this integration, the following permissions are required on the Monday.com app.  

- `boards:read`

### Activity log

[Activity log API docs](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/activity-logs)

Can be accessed using the OAuth [method](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/choosing-auth#method-2-using-oauth-to-issue-access-tokens).

Create your Monday app [guidelines](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/create-an-app#creating-an-app-in-the-developer-center) and make sure the needed permissions are granted for the app registration:
Required scope - boards:read
The Redirect URI - https://localhost

Enter your Client ID and Client Secret in the instance parameter fields.

Run the ***!monday-generate-login-url*** command in the War Room and follow the instructions:

To sign in, click the login URL and grant Cortex XSIAM permissions. You will be automatically redirected to a link with the following structure:
REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTH_CODE&region=REGION&scope=boards%3Aread&state=

Copy the AUTH_CODE (without the code= prefix) and paste it in your instance configuration under the Authorization code parameter.

Save the instance.
In the Playground, run the ***!monday-auth-test*** command. A 'Success' message is generated.

### Audit log
