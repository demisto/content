The Safe Browsing APIs (v4) let your client applications check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. 
Examples of unsafe web resources are social engineering sites (phishing and deceptive sites) and sites that host malware or unwanted software. 
Any URL found on a Safe Browsing list is considered unsafe. 
Set up instructions are available at Google API Console [Help Center](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/get-started)

Notice: Submitting indicators using the **url** command of this integration might make the indicator data publicly available.  See the vendorâ€™s documentation for more details.
