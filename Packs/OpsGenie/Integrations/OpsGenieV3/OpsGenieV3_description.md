# OpsGenie
**OpsGenie** is a cloud based service that enables operations teams to manage alerts generated by monitoring tools to ensure the right people are notified, and the problems are addressed in a timely manner.  
  
Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.  
1. Provide 'Server URL': The default server URL should be sufficient for most cases.  
2. Provide 'API Key': Retrieve your authentication token via the Teams API Integration section.  
Note: If 'Query' is used - Status, Priority, Tags will be overridden.  
  
In the following commands: ***!opsgenie-create-alert***, ***!opsgenie-add-responder-alert***, ***!opsgenie-create-incident***, ***!opsgenie-add-responder-incident***,   the *responders* argument **must** be a list of triples in the following order: *responder_type,value_type,value*.    
- The *responder_type* can be: team, user, escalation or schedule.    
- The *value_type* can be: id or name.    
- The *value* can be retrieved from the output of the `!opsgenie-get-teams`, `!opsgenie-get-schedules`, or `!opsgenie-get-escalations` commands.    
For example: user,id,123,team,name,test_team.
