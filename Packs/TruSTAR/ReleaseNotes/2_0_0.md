#### Integrations
##### TruSTAR v2
The TruSTAR v2 integration introduces rewritten code, tests, docstrings on code functions, and new commands.
For commands that return indicators, the data is put in 3 contexts:
- The standard context, without the malicious field because TruSTAR doesn't currently have a score for every indicator.
- DBotScore context with score as 0 for the same reason.
- TruSTAR context with all the information returned by the command.
Commands:
***trustar-get-reports***
***trustar-get-enclaves***
***trustar-related-indicators***
***trustar-indicators-metadata***
***trustar-indicator-summaries***
***trustar-get-whitelisted-indicators***
