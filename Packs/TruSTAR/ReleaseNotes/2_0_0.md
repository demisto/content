#### Integrations

##### TruSTAR v2

New Version of TruSTAR integration.
Rewriting the code from v1, adding tests, docstrings on code functions, adding new commands.

For commands returning indicators we are putting data on 3 contexts:

- The standard one without the malicious field as TruSTAR doesn't have a score for every indicator at this moment.
- DBotScore context with score as 0 for the same reason.
- TruSTAR context with all the information returned by the command.

Commands: 

trustar-get-reports
trustar-get-enclaves
trustar-related-indicators
trustar-indicators-metadata
trustar-indicator-summaries
trustar-get-whitelisted-indicators
trustar-move-report
