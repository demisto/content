#### Integrations
##### TruSTAR v2

Multiple optional parameters have been added to `trustar-search-indicators` and `trustar-search-reports` commands. This lets the user search indicators/reports using more filters.

`trustar-redact-report` command has been added. This command redacts a report (applying company's redaction terms to report body and title) and then submits a reports.

`trustar-get-phishing-submissions` and `trustar-get-phishing-indicators` were not working due to changes on TruSTAR's API. Phishing commands have been fixed and optional parameter `limit` has been added.
