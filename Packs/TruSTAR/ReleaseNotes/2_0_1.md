#### Integrations
##### TruSTAR v2
  - Arguments added
    - Multiple optional arguments have been added to `trustar-search-indicators` and `trustar-search-reports` commands. This lets the user search indicators/reports using more filters.
    - New optional argument `redact` on `trustar-submit-report` that gives users the possibility to redact a report before submission or not. By default the argument takes a 'NO' value (having the same functionality as before) but the user can specify `redact=YES` to redact the report (applying all terms in user company's redaction library to body and title) prior to submission.   
    
  - Fixes
    - `trustar-get-phishing-submissions` and `trustar-get-phishing-indicators` were not working due to changes on TruSTAR's API. Phishing commands have been fixed and optional parameter `limit` has been added.
