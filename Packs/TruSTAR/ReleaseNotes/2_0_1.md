#### Integrations
##### TruSTAR v2
Added support for multiple new filtering arguments to the **trustar-search-indicators** and the **trustar-search-reports** commands.
Added optional argument *redact* to the **trustar-submit-report** command which gives users the possibility to redact a report before submission.
Fixed an issue where the  **trustar-get-phishing-submissions** and  the **trustar-get-phishing-indicators** did not work due to changes in the TruSTAR API.
Added support for *limit* argument in the **trustar-get-phishing-submissions** and  the **trustar-get-phishing-indicators**.
