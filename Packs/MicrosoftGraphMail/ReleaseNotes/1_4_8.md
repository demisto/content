#### Integrations
##### Microsoft Graph Mail Single User
- Fixed an issue where the integration uses the **refresh token** integration parameter only for the first run of the integration and ignores it in subsequent runs.
- Added the **msgraph-mail-auth-reset*** command which allows the user to restart the authentication process by resetting the integration context if necessary.
- Updated the docker image to *demisto/crypto:1.0.0.47585*.
