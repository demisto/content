##### CrowdStrike Falcon X
Added the *polling* argument to the following commands:
- ***cs-fx-upload-file*** 
- ***cs-fx-submit-uploaded-file*** 
- ***cs-fx-submit-url***
When *polling* is set to true, the command will try to return the results.
The *polling* argument enables users to search CrowdStrike using a single command, that doesn't require **GenericPolling Playbook**. 
- Added the *extended_data* argument to the ***cs-fx-get-full-report*** command. When set to true the report will return with extended data which includes mitre attacks and signature information.
