#### Integrations

##### CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Sandbox

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.84405*.
- Fixed an issue for the commands `cs-fx-get-full-report`, and `cs-fx-get-report-summary`, where the report returned indicated an error, but it was not caught. The commands will now show a warning if an error is returned.
- Fixed an issue for the command `cs-fx-upload-file` with polling, where if the file report indicates an error, then the command will output the error and fail.

#### Playbooks

##### Detonate File - CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Sandbox v2

- Playbook now supports skipping unsupported files.
