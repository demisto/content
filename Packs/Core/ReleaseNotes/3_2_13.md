- New: This playbook addresses the following alerts:
 
- Msiexec execution of an executable from an uncommon remote location with a specific port
- Msiexec execution of an executable from an uncommon remote location without properties
 
Playbook Stages:
  
Analysis: 
 
- Check extracted URL reputation:
  - Determine if the MSI package was installed from a malicious source
  - If the URL is found to be malicious, the playbook will proceed directly to remediation steps
