#### Integrations

##### Investigation & Response

- Added support for **core-add-indicator-rule** command that upload iocs to xsiam. when `ioc_object` is defined, disregard any other provided arguments as `ioc_object` takes precedence. if `vendor_name`, `vendor_reputation`, and `vendor_reliability` are used, only a single vendor is supported. for multiple vendors, utilize an `ioc_object` in json format. adding the same indicator with different parameters will result in an update to the existing rule.
