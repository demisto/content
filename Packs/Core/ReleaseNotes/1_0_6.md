#### Playbooks
##### New: T1036 - Masquerading
- This playbook handles masquerading alerts based on the MITRE T1036 technique.
An attacker might leverage Microsoft Windows well-known image names to run malicious processes without being caught.

**Attacker's Goals:**

An attacker is attempting to masquerade as standard windows images by using a trusted name to execute malicious code.

**Investigative Actions:**

Investigate the executed process image and verify if it is malicious using:

* XDR trusted signers
* VT trusted signers
* VT detection rate
* NSRL DB

**Response Actions**

The playbook's first response action is a containment plan which is based on the initial data provided within the alert. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Auto block indicators
* Auto file quarantine
* Manual endpoint isolation

When the playbook executes, it checks for additional activity using the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook, and another phase, which includes containment and eradication, is executed.

This phase will execute the following containment actions:

* Manual block indicators
* Manual file quarantine
* Auto endpoint isolation

And the following eradication actions:

* Manual process termination
* Manual file deletion
* Manual reset of the userâ€™s password

##### New: NGFW Scan
- This playbook handles external and internal scanning alerts.

**Attacker's Goals:**

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.

**Investigative Actions:**

Investigate the scanner IP address using:

* IP enrichment:
* NGFW Internal Scan playbook
* Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook
* Entity enrichment

**Response Actions**

The playbook's response actions are based on the initial data provided within the alert. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Auto block IP address
* Report IP address (If configured as true in the playbook inputs)

When the playbook executes, it checks for additional activity using the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook, and another phase, which includes the Containment Plan playbook, is executed.
This phase will execute the following containment actions:

* Auto endpoint isolation
* Manual block indicators
* Manual file quarantine
* Manual disable user

##### New: NGFW Internal Scan
- This playbook investigates a scan where the source is an internal IP address.

An attacker might initiate an internal scan for discovery, lateral movement and more.

**Attacker's Goals:**

An attacker can leverage a scan for open ports and vulnerable systems on remote endpoints in an attempt to identify the endpoint operating system, firewall configuration, and exploitable services.

**Investigative Actions:**

* Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook

**Response Actions**

The playbook's response actions are based on the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook results. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Auto endpoint isolation
* Manual block indicators
* Manual file quarantine
 (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.6.0).
