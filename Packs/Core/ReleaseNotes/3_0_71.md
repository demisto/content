#### Playbooks

##### New: Scheduled task created with HTTP or FTP reference

- New: This playbook is designed to handle the alert "Scheduled task created with HTTP or FTP reference".

The playbook executes the following stages:

Investigation:
During the alert investigation, the playbook will perform the following:
- Checks the IP and the URL reputation.
- Checks the CGO process signature.
- Searches for related XDR agent alerts to determine if the creation of the scheduled task is part of an attack pattern.

Remediation:
- Remediation actions will be taken if the CGO process is unsigned, the IP or URL has a malicious reputation, or a related alert is detected. 
In these cases, the playbook will disable the scheduled task, block the malicious indicators, and close the alert.

Requires: To block the malicious URL and IP, configure 'Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS' integration.
