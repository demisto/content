##### New: Get entity alerts by MITRE tactics

- New: This playbook searches XDR alerts related to specific entities , on a given timeframe, based on MITRE tactics.
Note: The playbook's inputs enable manipulating the execution flow. Read the input descriptions for details.

##### New: Possible External RDP Brute-Force

- New: This playbook investigates a “Possible External RDP Brute Force” XDR Alert by gathering user, IP, and hostname information, and investigating if the following suspicious elements exists:

- "IP Reputation" - Dbot Score is 2-3 
- "Source geolocation" - RDP Connection made from rare geo-location 
-  Related to campaign - IP address is related to campaign, based on TIM module
-  Hunting results - the hunt for indicators related to the source IP and the related campaign returned results
-  XDR Alert search - XDR Alerts that related to the same username and endpoint, and to the MITRE tactics that comes after "Credential Access", were found.

Set verdict method:
* Critical Element - The "Critical Element" input allows you to select a specific element that, if identified as suspicious,  the investigation's final verdict will be deemed a "True Positive".

* Final Verdict -  Each suspicious element is being added to an array called "Suspicious Elements", which is used to count potential security threats. The array size will be compared to a final threshold. If the size is greater than or equal to the threshold, the investigation's final verdict will be deemed a "True Positive".

* User Engagement - The "UserEngagementThreshold" input allows you to set the number of suspicious elements that trigger user engagement. When this threshold is met, an email will be sent to the user and their manager asking for authorization of RDP activity. If the RDP activity is not authorized by the user, the investigation's final verdict will be deemed a "True Positive".


##### New: Possible External RDP Brute-Force - Set Verdict

- New: This playbook creating an array called "Suspicious Elements", which is used to count potential security threats. The following elements can be added to the array:

- "IP Reputation" - Dbot Score is 2-3 
- "Source geolocation" - RDP Connection made from rare geo-location 
-  Related to campaign - IP address is related to campaign, based on TIM module
-  Hunting results - the hunt for indicators related to the source IP and the related campaign returned results
-  XDR Alert search - XDR Alerts that related to the same username and endpoint, and to the MITRE tactics that comes after "Credential Access", were found.

The array will then be outputted and its size will be compared to a final threshold. If the size is greater than or equal to the threshold, the investigation's final verdict will be deemed a "True Positive."
