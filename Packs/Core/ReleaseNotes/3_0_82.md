##### New: Unprivileged process opened a registry hive

- This Playbook is designed to handle the 'Unprivileged process opened a registry hive' alerts and executes the following:

Investigation:
Check the signature of the Actor & CGO processes. 
Check the prevalence of the Actor & CGO process and Actor & CGO CommandLine
Check for related Cortex XDR alerts using MITRE tactics to identify any malicious activity.

Remediation:
Based on the signature status of the Actor & CGO processes, prevalence of the Actor & CGO process and Actor & CGO CommandLine, and related alerts if found, the playbook will terminate the causality process if any malicious parameters are found. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.10.0).
