#### Layouts

##### Default XDR Alert
 
Updated the layout to include Identity Detection & Response (ITDR) information about risky users and hosts involved in the alert.

#### Playbooks

##### Possible External RDP Brute-Force

- Added new Core XDR ITDR capabilities. The playbook now enriches the endpoint and account involved in the alert with identity risk information from Cortex Core. The new information enhances the decision making of the playbook and improves detection accuracy.
- Added new possible inputs for the "Critical Element" input. This lets the user decide whether the presence of a risky user or host should change the verdict of the alert to "malicious".  

##### Possible External RDP Brute-Force - Set Verdict

Updated the playbook to take into account the involvement of risky assets when setting a verdict for the alert.
