* Retrieve all incident-related alerts to consolidate context for further analysis.

**Investigation:**

* Analyze command-line activity to assess risks based on suspicious patterns.

* Check for high-confidence evidence, such as malicious IP addresses or suspicious command-line activity, to determine the next course of action.

* Evaluate medium-confidence detections and request analyst approval for further containment if required.

**Containment:**

* Attempt to terminate the malicious process tree using its causality ID.

* Provide guidance for manual process termination if the automated action fails.

* Propose endpoint isolation to prevent further compromise if malicious activity is confirmed.
