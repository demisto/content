Triage:

Early Containment:

- The playbook will check if the IP is suspicious. If it is, the playbook will suggest blocking the IP.

Investigation:

- The playbook assess the risk score of the user who successfully logged in and examine the legitimacy of the user agent. It verifies if the user has MFA configured. And analyzes the timestamps of the login attempts to detect patterns.

Containment:
- If there is a successful login attempt and the user's risk score is high, or if the user agent is detected as suspicious, or if the time intervals were automated, the playbook will clear the user's session. If the user doesn't have MFA, the playbook will recommend expiring the user's password.
