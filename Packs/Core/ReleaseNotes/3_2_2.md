##### Investigation & Response

- Added two new optional arguments to the ***core-run-script-execute-commands*** command to fix issues caused by special characters:
  - ***is_raw_command*** - Can be set to `true` to prevent the splitting of the ***command*** argument value by commas. Useful when using `||`, `&&`, `;` separators for controlling the flow of multiple commands.
  - ***command_type*** - Can be set to `powershell` to add a `powershell -Command` prefix to the ***command*** argument value and escape special characters according to the Powershell syntax.
