    description: "The resolution status of the item. Options are \"done\", \"inProgress\", \"pending\", \"recommended\". Note: The \"pending\" status is relevant only for tasks within a playbook. A task is considered pending primarily when the playbook is stopped and waiting for user input on a manual task. It can also be considered pending if the playbook is new and has not yet started, is paused, or is stopped. In a broader sense, tasks within an in-progress playbook might also be considered pending if they are awaiting completion."
