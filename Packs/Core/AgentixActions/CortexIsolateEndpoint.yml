description: >
  Isolates an endpoint through Cortex, restricting all network communication except the required connection to Cortex services.

  Workflow:
  1. Execute the "GetEndpointData" action with the "Cortex Core - IR" integration brand as input to get the endpoint ID (unless provided or returned from a previous action).
  2. Use this action to isolate the endpoint.
