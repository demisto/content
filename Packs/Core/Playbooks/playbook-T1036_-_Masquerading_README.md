This playbook handles masquerading alerts based on the MITRE T1036 technique.
An attacker might leverage Microsoft Windows well-known image names to run malicious processes without being caught.

**Attacker's Goals:**

An attacker is attempting to masquerade as standard windows images by using a trusted name to execute malicious code.

**Investigative Actions:**

Investigate the executed process image and verify if it is malicious using:

* XDR trusted signers
* VT trusted signers
* VT detection rate
* NSRL DB

**Response Actions**

The playbook's first response action is a containment plan which is based on the initial data provided within the alert. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Auto block indicators
* Auto file quarantine
* Manual endpoint isolation

When the playbook executes, it checks for additional activity using the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook, and another phase, which includes containment and eradication, is executed.

This phase will execute the following containment actions:

* Manual block indicators
* Manual file quarantine
* Auto endpoint isolation

And the following eradication actions:

* Manual process termination
* Manual file deletion
* Manual reset of the userâ€™s password
