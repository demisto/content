This playbook handles impossible traveler alerts.

An Impossible Traveler event occurs when multiple login attempts seen for a user from multiple remote countries in a short period of time, which shouldn't be possible. This may indicate the account is compromised.

**Attacker's Goals:**

Gain user-account credentials.

**Investigative Actions:**

Investigate the IP addresses and identities involved in the detected activity using:

* Impossible Traveler - Enrichment playbook
* CalculateGeoDistance automation

**Response Actions**

The playbook's first response actions are based on the data available within the alert. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Manual block indicators if the IP address found malicious
* Manual disable user
* Manual clear of the user’s sessions (Okta)

When the playbook continues, after validating the activity with the user’s manager, another phase of response actions is being executed, which includes:

* Auto block indicators
