IOCs provide the ability to alert on known malicious objects on endpoints across the organization. 

**Analysis Actions:**
The playbook will use several enrichment sources to determine the IOC verdict. Additionally, will use the Analytics module to run a prevalence check for the IOC.

**Response Actions:**
The playbook's first response action is a containment plan that is based on the playbook input. In that phase, the playbook will execute endpoint isolation

**Investigative Actions:**
When the playbook executes, it checks for additional abnormal activity using the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook that can indicate the endpoint might be compromised.

**Remediation Actions:**
In case results are found within the investigation phase, the playbook will execute remediation actions that include containment and eradication.

This phase will execute the following containment actions:

* File quarantine
* Endpoint isolation

And the following eradication actions:

* Manual process termination
* Manual file deletion
