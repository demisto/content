When an unknown executable, DLL, or macro attempts to run on a Windows or Mac endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent uses local analysis to determine if it is likely to be malware. Local analysis uses a static set of pattern-matching rules that inspect multiple file features and attributes, and a statistical model that was developed with machine learning on WildFire threat intelligence.

**Investigative Actions:**

Investigate the executed process image and verify if it is malicious using:

* XDR trusted signers
* VT trusted signers
* VT detection rate
* NSRL DB

**Response Actions**

The playbook's first response action is a containment plan that is based on the initial data provided within the alert. In that phase, the playbook will execute:

* Auto block indicators
* Auto file quarantine
* Manual endpoint isolation

When the playbook executes, it checks for additional activity using the Endpoint Investigation Plan playbook, and another phase, which includes containment and eradication, is executed.

This phase will execute the following containment actions:

* Manual block indicators
* Manual file quarantine
* Auto endpoint isolation

And the following eradication actions:

* Manual process termination
* Manual file deletion
* Manual reset of the userâ€™s password
