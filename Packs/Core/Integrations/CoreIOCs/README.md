The Cortex Core - IOCs integration uses the Cortex API for detection and response, by natively integrating network, endpoint, and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks.

## Configure Indicators detection

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Indicators detection.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.
