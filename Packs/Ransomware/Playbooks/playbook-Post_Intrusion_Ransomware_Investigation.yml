  Provides the first step in the investigation of ransomware attacks.
   The playbook requires the ransom note and an example of an encrypted file (<1MB) to try to identify the ransomware and find a recovery tool via the online database.
   You will be guided with further investigation steps throughout the playbook, some of the key features are:

  - Encrypted file owner investigation
   - Endpoint forensic investigation
   - Active Directory investigation
   - Timeline of the breach investigation
   - Indicator and account enrichment

  Playbook settings and mapping:
   For the full operation of the playbook, the following data should be mapped to the relevant incident fields.
   Username - Usernames (common incident field)
   Hostname - Hostnames (common incident field)

        -  File Hash\n-  Unique network connection \n\n2. Forensic Investigation :\n\
        Analyse Network Share, running process, network connection, auto-run data,\
        \ memory dump, and other forensics methods to help you gain more knowledge\
        \ about the ransomware.\n\n3. Search for additional infected endpoints:\n\
        Use the behavioral signature collected from the forensic investigation task\
        \ to search for additional infected endpoints.\n\nPerimeter Investigation\n\
        \nFor a proper recovery process, it is essential to set the timeline for the\
        \ breach. Encrypting the data is the final step in the attack. \nBefore data\
        \ encryption, attackers must have gained initial access and moved laterally\
        \ across the domain to gain higher privileges so they can distribute the encryption\
        \ payload to the highest number of endpoints. \n1. Use Cortex XSOAR to investigate\
        \ past incidents from the last three weeks with users/accounts involved in\
        \ the current incident. \n2. Investigate past incidents with file owner user/account\
        \ of the encrypted files. \n3. Look for a correlation between users/accounts\
        \ and past Phishing/Malware alerts. \n4. Use available security/network tools\
        \ to investigate and identify lateral movement in the domain.\n5. Look for\
        \ suspicious activity or known vulnerabilities on external-facing applications\
        \ and services like web servers/VPN/RDP.\n\n\n\n"
