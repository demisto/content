         3. Filter on the username of the affected user (all users should be authenticated to the proxy)
         4. Filter out URLs that has been categorised, you should only have uncategorized URLs on your list.
         5. Export list to CSV
         6. Sort the list by URLs, remove duplicates
         7. Make sure this is attached as artifact to the investigation
