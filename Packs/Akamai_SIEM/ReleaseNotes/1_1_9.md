#### Integrations

##### Akamai WAF SIEM

- Added limitations to **Fetch limit** and **page size** parameters due to Restrictions from the platform. The maximum allowed amount is 80k. Note that this change will not fail the execution, but if higher rates are configured, the fetch will use 80k. Note that in cases your the ingestion rate from the Akamai API is higher, the integration will detect it and immediately starts the next run.
- Fixed an issue where **fetch-events** failed with docker timeout error.
