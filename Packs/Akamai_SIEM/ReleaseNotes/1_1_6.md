#### Integrations

##### Akamai WAF SIEM

- Added the **Page size** integration parameter. Use this parameter to determine how many events to fetch on each request being made to Akamai.
- Fixed an issue where the integration sometimes returned duplicated events.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/auth-utils:1.0.0.115527*.
- Added the **akamai-siem-reset-offset** command which allows you to reset the integration context. Use this command when you want to remove offset history when fetching events.
