#### Integrations

##### Akamai WAF SIEM

- Added support for 416 error - the integration will now reset itself in a case of such error. If the issue persists, please refer to the troubleshooting in the integration docs.
- Added support for **send_events_to_xsiam** with multithreading. Use this if you wish to improve the ingestion rate of the integration.
- Added the **Skip events decoding** parameter, Use this parameter to avoid decoding the http message and attack data fields and speed up the ingestion rate.
- Added the **Send events to xsiam in multiple threads** parameter, Use this parameter to speed up the events ingestion rate in case your instance keeps bringing the limit events every interval.
