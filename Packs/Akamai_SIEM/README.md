## Overview

This pack enables using a Web Application Firewall (WAF), a security filter that protects against HTTP-based attacks by inspecting traffic before it reaches your application.
**Note:**
Use the native collector for log ingestion. The event collector will be deprecated in the next Cortex XSIAM version.

## This pack includes

Data normalization capabilities:

* Parsing and modeling rules normalize logs ingested via the Cortex XSIAM native collector.
* The *`akamai_waf_raw`* dataset enables querying ingested Akamai WAF SIEM logs in XQL Search.
