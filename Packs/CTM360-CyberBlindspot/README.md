In External Attack Surface Management, HackerView provides an inventory of your digital assets discovered automatically, identifies issues (including vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposures) in these digital assets, and generates a digital risk scorecard for your organization. The scorecard can also be generated for a limited number of your vendors for free.

In Digital Risk Protection, CyberBlindspot detects threats across the surface, deep, and dark web and monitors for over 40 threat types, i.e., actual or potential threats targeting your organization, brands, and executives. These incidents include phishing, social media fraud, suspicious mobile apps, look-alike domains, data leakage, etc.
