Take action on incidents derived from CTM360 CBS threat intelligence that is directly linked to your organization.
This integration was integrated and tested with version `1.0.0` of CTM360_CyberBlindspot.

## Configure CTM360 CyberBlindspot on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for CTM360 CyberBlindspot.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Incident Mirroring Direction | Choose the direction to mirror the incident: Incoming \(from CyberBlindspot to Cortex XSOAR\), Outgoing \(from Cortex XSOAR to CyberBlindspot\), or Incoming and Outgoing \(from/to Cortex XSOAR and CyberBlindspot\). | False |
    | First fetch (&lt;number&gt; &lt;time unit&gt;, e.g., 12 hours. Default is `7 days`) | The time the incidents should be fetched starting from. | False |
    | API Key | The CTM360 CyberBlindspot API Key to use for fetching data. | True |
    | Maximum Number of Incidents per Fetch | Default is 25. Maximum is 200. | True |
    | Fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Date From | Set the date/time incidents should be fetched from \(setting this will always get incidents from this date/time. Normally<br/>you should not set it and rely on \`First Fetch\`\). Format should be \[%d-%m-%Y %H:%M\], i.e.: '22-01-2024 13:15'<br/> | False |
    | Date To | Set the date/time incidents should be fetched up to \(setting this will always get incidents before this date/time. Normally<br/>you should not set it and rely on \`First Fetch\`\). Format should be \[%d-%m-%Y %H:%M\], i.e.: '22-01-2024 13:15'<br/> | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Incident type |  |  |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and CTM360 CyberBlindspot corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in CTM360 CyberBlindspot events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in CTM360 CyberBlindspot events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and CTM360 CyberBlindspot events will be reflected in both directions. |


Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and CTM360 CyberBlindspot.
