This pack bundles all the different kinds of free enrichers available for TIM. Each pack will have tags specifying if the enricher is free, requires sign-up, credentials, etc.
This pack does not contain independent content; rather, its primary purpose is to aggregate and install various optional dependency packs based on the user's choice upon installation.

These 4 new tags have been added to all the relevant feeds:
- **Plug & Enrich** - Free enricher, no credentials or registration needed.
- **Free Enricher** - Free to use but credentials \ sign-up is needed.
