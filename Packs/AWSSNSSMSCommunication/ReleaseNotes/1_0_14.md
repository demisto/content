#### Integrations

##### AWS SNS SMS Communication

- **Added support for SMSAskUser automation script format**
  - Now properly handles messages from SMSAskUser script: "Question - Reply option1 or option2: GUID@incident|task"
  - Extracts options from "Reply Yes or No" format
  - Compatible with both SMSAskUser script and built-in Ask tasks with URLs

- **Recommendation**: Use the **SMSAskUser automation script** instead of built-in Ask tasks for SMS communication
  - SMSAskUser creates proper entitlement GUIDs that work with SMS reply codes
  - Built-in Ask tasks create web URLs that don't work well over SMS

#### Scripts

##### SMSAskUser

- Use this script in playbooks for SMS-based questions instead of built-in Ask tasks
- Example usage:
  ```
  scriptName: SMSAskUser
  scriptarguments:
    phone: "+1234567890"
    message: "Approve incident?"
    option1: "Yes"
    option2: "No"
    task: "${currentTaskId}"
  ```
