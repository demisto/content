##### AWS SNS SMS Communication

- **DEPRECATED APPROACH - DO NOT USE**: Attempted URL decoding for built-in Ask tasks
  - Built-in XSOAR Ask tasks create URLs AFTER send-notification returns
  - Cannot extract or decode entitlement GUIDs from URLs in the message
  - This approach does not work and will be removed in next version

- **Use SMSAskUser automation script instead:**
  - SMSAskUser creates entitlement GUID before calling send-notification
  - Format: "Question - Reply Yes or No: GUID@incident|task"
  - Integration extracts GUID and options from this format
  - Generates reply codes: "Question\nYes (1234) or No (5678)"
  - This is the ONLY supported method for Ask-style SMS communication
