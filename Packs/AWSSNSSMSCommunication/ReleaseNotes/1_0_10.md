#### Integrations

##### AWS SNS SMS Communication

- Changed test-module to use SQS *get_queue_attributes* instead of SNS *list_topics* to match official AWS integrations pattern and align with required IAM permissions. The integration now tests the configured SQS queue which is always required for the long-running execution.
