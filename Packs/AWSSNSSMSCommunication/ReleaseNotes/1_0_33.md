#### Integrations

##### AWS SNS SMS Communication

- Added **SMS Reply Feedback** feature for improved user experience:
  - **Success feedback**: Sends confirmation SMS when a reply is successfully processed (e.g., "1234 - Thank you for your response!")
  - **Failure feedback**: When an unrecognized reply code is received, lists all available reply codes for active questions (e.g., "We couldn't process your response. Please respond with one of the available reply codes: Yes (1234), No (5678)")
- Added new configuration parameters:
  - **Enable Reply Feedback SMS**: Toggle to enable/disable feedback messages (default: enabled)
  - **Success Message Template**: Customizable success message with variables: {reply_code}, {chosen_option}, {phone_number}
- Feedback is only sent when there are active entitlements for the phone number, preventing unnecessary messages
