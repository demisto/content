#### Integrations

##### AWS SNS SMS Communication

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Redesigned reply code system for proper multi-question support
  - Each option now has a unique reply code (e.g., "Yes (1234) or No (5678)")
  - Users reply with just the code number (e.g., "1234" to choose "Yes")
  - Enables handling multiple active questions to the same phone number simultaneously

- Added *clean_ask_task_message_and_generate_codes()* function that:
  - Strips URLs from XSOAR Ask task messages
  - Generates unique 4-digit codes for each reply option
  - Returns code-to-option mapping (e.g., {"1234": "Yes", "5678": "No"})

- Updated *save_entitlement()* to store code-to-option mappings instead of single reply codes
- Updated *find_entitlement_by_reply_code()* to return both entitlement and chosen option
- Updated *process_sms_reply()* to validate 4-digit codes and map them to chosen options
- Updated *list_entitlements_command()* to display all codes for each entitlement

Messages now appear as:
```
Do you like PANcakes?
Yes (2345) or No (6432)
```

User replies with just "2345" and system knows they chose "Yes" for that specific question.
