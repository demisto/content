PAN-OS Network Operations provides a series of use cases designed to manage the PAN-OS Network Topology.

## System Information

The System Information use case discovers the PAN-OS topology and presents it in a single incident layout,
allowing for easy pivoting and monitoring to the other use cases in this pack.

## Platform UpgradeA

The Platform Upgrade use case manages the upgrade of the entire PAN-OS topology to a consistent version,
including managing Panorama upgrades, HA firewall and standalone firewall upgrades.

## Configuration Hygiene - Visibility 

This use case compares the configuration of the PAN-OS environment with PAN published best practices for
visibility. This ensures your rules, profiles, and zones are configured to log all relevant traffic and 
threat information.
