#### Integrations
##### Prisma Access
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/netmiko:1.0.0.47037*.
- Fixed an issue where the command **prisma-access-logout-user** did not work properly when the *domain* argument was provided unnecessarily. 
- The integration parameter *Domain* is now optional and not required.
