Use the Prisma Access integration to run SSH CLI commands and query the connection states for all tunnels. If any tunnels are down - the playbook escalates to a manual task for remediation and provides recommendations on next steps in the task description.

The playbook can be run as a job, or triggered from an incoming event to confirm an initial suspicion (such as a tunnel log from Cortex Data Lake) to validate that the issue still exists.
