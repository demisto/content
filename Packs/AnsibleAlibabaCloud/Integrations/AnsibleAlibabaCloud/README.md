This integration enables the management of Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server, all you need to do is provide credentials you are ready to use the feature rich commands.

To use this integration, configure an instance of this integration. This will associate a credential to be used to manage a Alibaba tenancy. Create separate instances for each region being managed.

## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Alibaba Cloud
To use this integration you must generate an Access/Secret token for your Aliyun tenancy.
1. Navigate to the [Resource Access Management](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/users)
2. Create a service account dedicated for XSOAR with Programmatic Access enabled
3. Record the Access and Secret tokens
4. Navigate to [Permmions > Grants](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/permissions)
4. Grant the service account principal either `AliyunECSFullAccess` or `AliyunECSReadOnlyAccess` permissions. 

## Configure Ansible Alibaba Cloud on Cortex XSOAR
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Ansible Alibaba Cloud.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Access Key | Aliyun Cloud access key | True |
    | Access Secret Key | Aliyun Cloud secret key | True |
    | Region | Aliyun Cloud region | True |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Idempotence
The action commands in this integration are idempotent. This means that the result of performing it once is exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any intervening actions.

## State Arguement
Some of the commands in this integration take a state argument. These define the desired end state of the object being managed. As a result these commands are able to perform multiple management operations depending on the desired state value. Common state values are:
| **State** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| present | Object should exist. If not present, the object will be created with the provided parameters. If present but not with correct parameters, it will be modified to met provided parameters. |
| running | Object should be running not stopped. |
| stopped | Object should be stopped not running. |
| restarted | Object will be restarted. |
| absent | Object should not exist. If it it exists it will be deleted. |


## Complex Command Inputs
Some commands may require structured input arguments such as `lists` or `dictionary`, these can be provided in standard JSON notation wrapped in double curly braces. For example a argument called `dns_servers` that accepts a list of server IPs 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 would be entered as `dns_servers="{{ ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'] }}"`.

Other more advanced data manipulation tools such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html)/[Jinja2 filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#builtin-filters) can also be used in-line. For example to get a [random number](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#random-number-filter) between 0 and 60 you can use `{{ 60 | random }}`.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### Troubleshooting
The Ansible-Runner container is not suitable for running as a non-root user.
Therefore, the Ansible integrations will fail if you follow the instructions in the Cortex XSOAR [Docker Hardening Guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Docker-Hardening-Guide). 

The `docker.run.internal.asuser` server configuration causes the software that is run inside of the Docker containers utilized by Cortex XSOAR to run as a non-root user account inside the container.

The Ansible-Runner software is required to run as root as it applies its own isolation via bwrap to the Ansible execution environment. 

This is a limitation of the Ansible-Runner software itself https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/611.

A workaround is to use the `docker.run.internal.asuser.ignore` server setting and to configure Cortex XSOAR to ignore the Ansible container image by setting the value of `demisto/ansible-runner` and afterwards running /reset_containers to reload any containers that might be running to ensure they receive the configuration.

See step 2 of this [guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Run-Docker-with-Non-Root-Internal-Users) for complete instructions.
