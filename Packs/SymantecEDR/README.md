## Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Integration

Symantec EDR uses machine learning and behavioral analytics to detect and expose suspicious network activities. Symantec EDR alerts you about potentially harmful activity, prioritizes incidents for quick triage, and lets you navigate endpoint activity records during your forensic analysis of potential attacks. 

Symantec EDR lets you contain suspicious events, isolate potentially compromised devices, and delete malicious files and associated artifacts.
