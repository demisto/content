Adds the unknown indicators or updates/removes the indicators identified as a known asset in the RiskIQ Digital Footprint inventory according to the user inputs for each asset. To select the indicators you want to add, go to playbook inputs, choose "from indicators" and set your query. For example reputation:None etc. The purpose of the playbook is to check if the indicators with the unknown reputation are known assets. The default playbook query is "reputation:None". In case indicators with different reputations are to be added to the inventory, the query must be edited accordingly. This playbook cannot be run in quiet mode. This playbook needs to be used with caution as it might use up the integrationâ€™s API license when running for large amounts of indicators.
