Enriches the "RiskIQAsset" type of indicators with basic information and CVEs detected for the asset, performs a vulnerability scan for "Host" and "IP Address" type of assets, and enriches received information in the context as well as provides the user to perform whitelisting of a list of "IP Address" type of assets. This playbook also enriches the detected CVEs. To select the indicators you want to enrich, go to playbook inputs, choose "from indicators" and set your query. For example type:RiskIQAsset etc. The default playbook query is "type:RiskIQAsset". In case indicators with specific "riskiqassettype" are to be enriched, the query must be edited accordingly. This playbook needs to be used with caution as it might use up the integrations' API license when running for large amounts of indicators.
