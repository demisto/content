### Get access to RiskIQ Digital Footprint
RiskIQ Digital Footprint requires an existing enterprise contract in order to function. Existing clients can use their API keys in order to enable the functionality within XSOAR. If API keys are unknown or have been misplaced, clients can contact their account representative directly or send an email to [support@riskiq.com](mailto:support@riskiq.com). RiskIQ offers a free Digital Footprint Snapshot service upon request that serves as a preview to enterprise functionality. Interested parties can contact [sales@riskiq.com](mailto:sales@riskiq.com) in order to receive more information on that offering.
