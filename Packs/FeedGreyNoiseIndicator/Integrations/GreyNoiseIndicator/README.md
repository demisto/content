GreyNoise is a cybersecurity platform that collects and analyzes Internet-wide scan and attack traffic. With this integration, users can contextualize existing alerts, filter false-positives, identify compromised devices, and track emerging threats. This Integration provides a feed of IPv4 Internet Scanners from GreyNoise.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 2.0.1 of GreyNoise SDK.
