WithSecure event collector integration for Cortex XSIAM.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of WithSecure Elements API

## Configure WithSecure Event Collector in Cortex

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | WithSecure API endpoint (e.g., https://api.connect.withsecure.com) | True |
| Client ID | Client ID for OAuth2 authentication | True |
| Client Secret | Client Secret for OAuth2 authentication | True |
| First fetch timestamp (&lt;number&gt; &lt;time unit&gt;, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days, 3 months, 1 year) | How far back to fetch events on first run | False |
| Maximum number of events per fetch, Max 1000 | Maximum events to fetch per interval | False |
| Trust any certificate (not secure) | Skip SSL certificate verification | False |
| Use system proxy settings | Use system proxy for API calls | False |

## Authentication Process

To create API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret):

1. Login to [Elements Security Center](https://elements.withsecure.com/) as EPP administrator
2. Navigate to **Management > API Clients**
3. Change scope to the target organization
4. Click **Add new**
5. Enter description and configure permissions:
   - **Read-only**: For event collection and querying (recommended for most use cases)
   - **Read-write**: For incident management and response actions (isolation, scan, etc.)
6. **Important**: Save the Client Secret immediately (shown only once)
7. Note the Client ID

For detailed instructions, see [WithSecure API Documentation](https://connect.withsecure.com/getting-started/elements).

## Supported Event Types

The integration collects security events from multiple engines:

### Endpoint Protection (EPP)
- Real-time and manual file scanning
- DeepGuard behavioral analysis
- Application Control
- Device Control
- DataGuard
- Firewall
- Browsing Protection
- Web Traffic Scanning
- Connection Control
- Tamper Protection
- Integrity Checker
- AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)
- System Events Log

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Broad Context Detections (BCDs)
- Incident lifecycle (created, updated, closed, merged)
- Lateral movement detection
- Credential theft detection
- Malware and PUP detection
- Advanced threat behaviors

### Collaboration Protection (ECP)
- Email scanning (malware, phishing)
- Microsoft Teams scanning
- SharePoint scanning
- OneDrive scanning
- Inbox rule monitoring
- Breached account detection

### Exposure Management (XM)
- Security recommendations
- Vulnerability assessments
- Risk scoring

## Use Cases

### 1. Automated Threat Response
Use the isolation commands to automatically isolate compromised endpoints when critical EDR incidents are detected.

**Example Workflow:**
1. Fetch EDR incident events
2. Check incident severity and risk level
3. Get device details
4. Isolate endpoint if risk is severe
5. Add comment to incident
6. Update incident status

### 2. Incident Investigation
Query incidents, get detailed detections, and track investigation progress.

**Example Commands:**
```
!with-secure-get-incidents status=new risk_level=high
!with-secure-get-incident-detections incident_id=<incident_id>
!with-secure-add-incident-comment incident_ids=<incident_id> comment="Under investigation"
!with-secure-update-incident-status incident_id=<incident_id> status=inProgress
```

### 3. Endpoint Management
Monitor and manage endpoint protection status across your organization.

**Example Commands:**
```
!with-secure-get-devices protection_status=isolated
!with-secure-get-devices online=false limit=50
!with-secure-release-endpoint device_ids=<device_id>
```

### 4. Malware Containment
Trigger on-demand scans when suspicious activity is detected.

**Example Command:**
```
!with-secure-scan-endpoint device_ids=<device_id1>,<device_id2>
!with-secure-get-device-operations device_id=<device_id>
```

## Important Notes

### API Limitations
- Maximum 200 security events per API request
- Maximum 50 incidents per request
- Maximum 200 devices per request
- Maximum 5 devices for isolation/scan operations at once
- Maximum 10 incidents for bulk comment operations

### OAuth2 Authentication
- Tokens are automatically renewed before expiration
- Token expiration time is managed by the integration
- Requires `connect.api.read` scope for read operations
- Requires `connect.api.write` scope for write operations (isolation, updates, etc.)

### Response Actions
- Isolation requires Windows computers in active state
- Operations are asynchronous - use `with-secure-get-device-operations` to check status
- Operation status: pending, finished, ongoing, failed, internalError, unknownError

### Best Practices
- Use `persistenceTimestamp` for event collection (more reliable than `serverTimestamp`)
- Filter incidents by `archived=false` for better performance
- Monitor isolated endpoints and release them after threat remediation
- Close incidents with appropriate resolution after investigation
