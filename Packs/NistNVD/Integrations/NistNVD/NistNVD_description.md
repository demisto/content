The National Vulnerability Database (NVD), https://nvd.nist.gov, allows government agencies, software
vendors, and researchers to search and view information about vulnerabilities and vulnerable products. In
the Fall of 2019, NVD began offering web services to allow computer applications to better access the
NVD data.
