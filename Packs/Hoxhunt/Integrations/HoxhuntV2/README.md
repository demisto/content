## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Hoxhunt v2 corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:

1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in Hoxhunt v2 events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in Hoxhunt v2 events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and Hoxhunt v2 events will be reflected in both directions. |


Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Hoxhunt v2.
