##### Tanium Threat Response v2
- You can now filter fetched alerts by label name with the *filter_by_label_name* argument in the **fetch-incidents** command parameter of the instance configuration. 
- Added the intel document data to the fetched alert. When an incident for an alert is created, the intel document data is available for use in mappers or classifiers.
- Added the intel document labels to the fetched alert. When an incident for an alert is created, an additional API call is made to get the intel doc label names (useful for mapping or preprocessing incidents).
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/lxml:1.0.0.31639*.
