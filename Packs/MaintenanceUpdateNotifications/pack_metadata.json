It allows you to filter by region to ensure you are only receiving relevant notifications. Once installed, you must configure the RSS Feed integration to fetch from https://status.paloaltonetworks.com/history.rss and uncheck the Fetches Indicators checkbox. It is highly recommended to watch the demo video to see how to configure the integration and job so this can run on a regular interval to provide maintenance notifications.",
