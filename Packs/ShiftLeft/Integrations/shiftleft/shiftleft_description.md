## ShiftLeft CORE

ShiftLeft CORE provides static application security testing (SAST) that can be integrated into your CI/CD for automated scans. Each test is completed in minutes and, depending on the complexity of your application, can be run at each pull request.  Known open source vulnerabilities are automatically checked against data flow analysis to tell whether or not an attacker can "reach" them from the attack surface of the application.

A single scan combines:

- Static analysis for risk in custom code.
- Software composition analysis for known issues in open source libraries.
- Secrets detection.

High-risk issues are listed with their corresponding OWASP Top Ten and attacker-reachable CVE categories.

With ShiftLeft CORE and Cortex XSOAR, Application Security engineers can run playbooks in order to:

- Gather application threat intelligence to help prioritize bug fixes.
- Identify and create incidents to rotate secrets discovered in code.
- Proactively monitor applications for critical attacker-reachable vulnerabilities that enter production.

To use this content pack, you will need to have an enterprise account with ShiftLeft CORE to access the API and get coverage for known open source vulnerabilities. To get your Org ID and Token in ShiftLeft CORE:
- Log in to ShiftLeft.
- Click the avatar in the top-right and select Account Settings.
- On the right side (under Organization Info), you will see both the "Org ID" and Access Token . You can copy from the field or click the “copy to clipboard” link.
