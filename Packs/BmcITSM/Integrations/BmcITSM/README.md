## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and BMC Helix ITSM corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in BMC Helix ITSM events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in BMC Helix ITSM events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and BMC Helix ITSM events will be reflected in both directions. |

3. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding event is closed in BMC Helix ITSM.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and BMC Helix ITSM.
