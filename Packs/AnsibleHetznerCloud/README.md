This pack enables you to integrate with Hetzner Cloud. Hetzner provides Cloud Compute services based out of their European data centers.

This integration enables the management of Hetzner Cloud Services using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server. The Ansible modules have been exposed as XSOAR commands, and allow you to use them without needing to know Ansible.
