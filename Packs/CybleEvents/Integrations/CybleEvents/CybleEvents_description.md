Cyble Events is an integration that will help existing Cyble Vision users. This integration would allow users to access
the API available as part of Vision Licensing and integrate the data into XSOAR.
 
Existing users need to use the URL and Access Token as part of Cyble Vision subscription.
 
For an Access Token, go to User Settings in your Cyble Vision account, and press 'Access API'.
You can also contact your Account Manager to get the Access Token.
