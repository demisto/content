Cyble Events is an integration which will help existing Cyble Vision users. This integration would allow users to access
the API available as part of Vision Licensing and integrate the data into XSOAR.

Existing user needs to use the URL and Access Token as part of Cyble Vision subscription.

For an Access Token, go to user settings at your Cyble Vision account, and press Access API. 
You can also contact your Account Manager to get the Access Token.
