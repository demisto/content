#### Modeling Rules

##### OneLogin Modeling Rule

- Updated the modeling rules schema metadata configuration file by toggling the **is_array** property for the **user_id** field from *true* to *false*. 
- Fixed an issue with the **event_type_id** field mapping. 
- Added an event name enrichment for each event type id:
  -  Updated the **event_type_id** field mapping: **event_type_id** -> **xdm.event.original_event_type** field. 
  -  Added a mapping to the **xdm.event_type** field, which now contains the corresponding event name for the event type id.
- Improved implementation for the modeling rules:
  - Added support for IPv6 in mapping the **ipaddr** field.
  - Added a mapping of the event actor related fields to their corresponding **xdm.source.*** fields.  
  - Added a mapping for **policy_name** field:  **policy_name** -> **xdm.network.rule**. 
- Updated the modeling rule ID metadata for compatibility.
