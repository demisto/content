Ingest indicator feeds from TAXII 2.0 and 2.1 servers.

## Configure TAXII 2 Feed on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for TAXII 2 Feed.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

| **Parameter** | **Required** |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch indicators | False |
| Indicator Reputation | False |
| Source Reliability | True |
| Traffic Light Protocol Color | False
| Feed Fetch Interval | False |
| Bypass exclusion list | False |
| Discovery Service URL \(e.g. https://example.net/taxii\) | True |
| Username / API Key / Custom Auth Header | False |
| Collection Name To Fetch Indicators From | False |
| Full Feed Fetch | False |
| Max Indicators Per Fetch \(disabled for Full Feed Fetch\) | False |
| First Fetch Time | False |
| Max STIX Objects Per Poll | False |
| Complex Observation Mode | False |
| Trust any certificate \(not secure\) | False |
| Use system proxy settings | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

### Using API Token authentication
In order to use the integration with an API token you'll first need to change the `Username / API Key (see '?')` field to `_api_token_key`. Following this step, you can now enter the API Token into the `Password` field - this value will be used as an API key.


### Using custom authentication header
In case the TAXII 2 server you're trying to connect to requires a custom authentication header, you'll first need to change the `Username / API Key (see '?')` field to `_header:` and the custom header name, e.g. `_header:custom_auth`. Following this step, you can now enter the custom auth header value into the `Password` field - this value will be used as a custom auth header.

### Complex Observation Mode
Two or more Observation Expressions MAY be combined using a complex observation operator such as "AND", "OR", and "FOLLOWEDBY". e.g. `[ IP = 'b' ] AND [ URL = 'd' ]`. These relationships are not represented in in CORTEX XSOAR TIM indicators. You can opt to create them while ignoring these relations, or you can opt to ignore these expressions - if you chose the latter, then no indicator will be created for complex observations.


## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Demisto CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
