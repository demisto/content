- additionalinfo: Incremental feeds pull only new or modified indicators that have been sent from the integration. As the determination if the indicator is new or modified happens on the 3rd-party vendor's side, and only indicators that are new or modified are sent to Cortex XSOAR, all indicators coming from these feeds are labeled new or modified.

- additionalinfo: Set the number of stix object that will be requested with each taxii
    poll (http request). A single fetch is made of several taxii polls. Changing this
    setting can help speed up fetches, or fix issues on slower networks. Please note
    server restrictions may apply, overriding and limiting the "requested limit".
