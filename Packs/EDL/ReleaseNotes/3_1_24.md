#### Integrations

##### Generic Export Indicators Service

- Added a new `X-EDL-Origin-Size` header for HTTP responses representing the amount of indicators fetched before formatting. (The amount of indicators post-formatting is represented by the existing `X-EDL-Size` header.)
- Improved the **Troubleshooting** documentation section.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/flask-nginx:1.0.0.58905*.
