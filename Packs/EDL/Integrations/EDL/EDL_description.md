## How to Access the EDL Service

There are two ways that you can access the EDL service.

### Access the EDL Service by URL and Port (HTTP)
In a web browser, go to **http://*demisto_address*:*listen_port***.


### Access the EDL Service by Instance Name (HTTPS)
**Note: The EDL will be open to the same network the XSOAR Server is accessible. Make sure you are aware of the network risks. Enabling strong authentication is highly recommended if the route is open to the public.**

To access the EDL service by instance name, make sure ***Instance execute external*** is enabled. 

1. In Cortex XSOAR, go to **Settings > About > Troubleshooting**.
2. In the **Server Configuration** section, verify that the `instance.execute.external.<instance_name>` key is set to `true`. If this key does not exist, click **+ Add Server Configuration** and add the `instance.execute.external.<instance_name>` and set the value to `true`. See [this documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/long-running-invoke) for further information.
3. In a web browser, go to `https://<cortex-xsoar_address>/instance/execute/<instance_name>/`.


### Modify Request Parameters Through the URL
Use the following arguments in the URL to modify the request:

1. **n** - The maximum number of entries in the output. If no value is provided, will use the value specified in the *List Size* parameter configured in the instance configuration.
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?n=50
2. **s** - The starting entry index from which to export the indicators.
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?s=10&n=50
3. **q** - The query used to retrieve indicators from the system. Make sure to [URL encode](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?q=type:IP+and+reputation:Bad
4. **sp** - If set will strip ports off URLs, otherwise will ignore URLs with ports.
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?v=panosurl&sp 
5. **di** - If set will ignore URLs that are not compliant with PAN-OS URL format instead of being rewritten.
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?v=panosurl&di
6. **tr** - Whether to collapse IPs. 
    * 0 - Do not collapse. 
    * 1 - Collapse to ranges.
    * 2 - Collapse to CIDRs.
 * Example: https://{cortex-xsoar_instance}/instance/execute/{EDL_instance_name}?q="type:ip and sourceBrand:my_source"&tr=1

### When running in On-Demand mode
Make sure you run the `!edl-update` command for the first time to initialize the export process.
