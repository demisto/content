Simple, manual process to modify external dynamic lists (EDLs) in XSOAR. This pack may help replace an existing manual process for updating firewall allowlists and blocklists, so analysts may make these changes directly in XSOAR. Simply paste in a list of indicators to add or remove them from the EDL. 

Note: This pack does not perform indicator type validation at this time. Indicators will be added to the EDL exactly as entered.

## What does this pack do?
- Add manually inputted list of indicators to given EDL *or* remove from given EDL
