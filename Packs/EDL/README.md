Simple, manual process to modify external dynamic lists (EDLs) in Cortex <~XSOAR>XSOAR</~XSOAR><~XSIAM>XSIAM</~XSIAM>. This pack may help replace an existing manual process for updating firewall allowlists and blocklists, so analysts may make these changes directly in Cortex <~XSOAR>XSOAR</~XSOAR><~XSIAM>XSIAM</~XSIAM>. You just need to simply paste in a list of indicators to add or remove them from the EDL. 

Note: This pack does not perform indicator type validation at this time. Indicators will be added to the EDL exactly as entered.
