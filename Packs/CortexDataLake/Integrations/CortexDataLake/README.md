## Overview
---

Palo Alto Networks Cortex Data Lake provides cloud-based, centralized log storage and aggregation for your on premise, virtual (private cloud and public cloud) firewalls, for Prisma Access, and for cloud-delivered services such as Cortex XDR
This integration was integrated and tested with version 2 of Cortex Data Lake



---

## Configure Cortex Data Lake on Demisto
---

1. Go to the [HUB](https://apps.paloaltonetworks.com/apps) and select the `Demisto v2` app
2. In the War Room, run the command `!GetLicenseID` to get the `license ID`.
3. Go to __Settings__ > __ABOUT__ > __License__ to get the `Customer Name`.
4. Insert the `license ID` and the `Customer Name` in the required fields and complete the authentication process in order to get the __Authentication Token__  __Registration ID__ __Encryption Key__
5. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
6. Search for Palo Alto Networks Cortex v2.
7. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __Authentication Token__: From the authentication process
    * __Registration ID__: From the authentication process
    * __Encryption Key__: From the authentication process
    * __proxy__: Use system proxy settings
    * __insecure__: Trust any certificate (not secure)
    * __Fetch incidents__: Whether to fetch incidents or not
    * __first_fetch_timestamp__: First fetch time (\<number\> \<time unit\>, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days, 3 months, 1 year)
    * __Severity of events to fetch (Firewall)__: Select from all,Critical,High,Medium,Low,Informational,Unused
    * __Subtype of events to fetch (Firewall)__: Select from all,attack,url,virus,spyware,vulnerability,file,scan,flood,packet,resource,data,url-content,wildfire,extpcap,wildfire-virus,http-hdr-insert,http-hdr,email-hdr,spyware-dns,spyware-wildfire-dns,spyware-wpc-dns,spyware-custom-dns,spyware-cloud-dns,spyware-raven,spyware-wildfire-raven,spyware-wpc-raven,wpc-virus,sctp
    * __Incidents fetched per query__: How many incidents will be fetched per query. Caution: high number could create overload. Default is 10.
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

In order for the integration to work, the following URLs need to be accessible:

 - For authentication: 
   - `oproxy.demisto.ninja`
   - `api.paloaltonetworks.com `
 - For API requests, one of the following:
   - US: `api.us.cdl.paloaltonetworks.com`
   - EU: `api.nl.cdl.paloaltonetworks.com`

## Fetched Incidents Data
Fetches Firewall threat logs as incidents

## Additional Information

---
* In the documented CDL v2, You must now specify the customer's instance ID when you identify the log type that you want to query
against. That is, log types must be fully qualified and the instance ID is a part of the fully qualified name:
`<instanceID>.firewall.traffic`
However in this integration the instance ID is added automatically to the query so the name `firewall.traffic` is a valid table name
* The SQL syntex supported for queries is `csql`
