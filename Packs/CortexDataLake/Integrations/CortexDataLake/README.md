## Overview
---

Palo Alto Networks Cortex Data Lake provides cloud-based, centralized log storage and aggregation for your on premise, virtual (private cloud and public cloud) firewalls, for Prisma Access, and for cloud-delivered services such as Cortex XDR
This integration was integrated and tested with version 2 of Cortex Data Lake

---

## Configure Cortex Data Lake on Cortex XSOAR
---

1. Go to the [HUB](https://apps.paloaltonetworks.com/apps) and select the `Cortex XSOAR` app
2. In the War Room, run the command `!GetLicenseID` to get the `license ID`.
3. Go to __Settings__ > __ABOUT__ > __License__ to get the `Customer Name`.
4. Insert the `license ID` and the `Customer Name` in the required fields and complete the authentication process in order to get the __Authentication Token__  __Registration ID__ __Encryption Key__
5. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
6. Search for Cortex Data Lake.
7. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __Authentication Token__: From the authentication process
    * __Registration ID__: From the authentication process
    * __Encryption Key__: From the authentication process
    * __Fetch incidents__: Whether to fetch incidents or not
    * __first_fetch_timestamp__: First fetch time (\<number\> \<time unit\>, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days, 3 months, 1 year)
    * __Fetch Table__: Choose the table from which incidents will be fetched.
    * __Severity of events to fetch (Firewall)__: Select from all,Critical,High,Medium,Low,Informational,Unused
    * __Subtype of events to fetch (Firewall)__: Select from all,attack,url,virus,spyware,vulnerability,file,scan,flood,packet,resource,data,url-content,wildfire,extpcap,wildfire-virus,http-hdr-insert,http-hdr,email-hdr,spyware-dns,spyware-wildfire-dns,spyware-wpc-dns,spyware-custom-dns,spyware-cloud-dns,spyware-raven,spyware-wildfire-raven,spyware-wpc-raven,wpc-virus,sctp
    * __Fetch Fields__: Comma-separated fields that will be fetched with every incident, e.g., "pcap,session_id". Enter "*" for all possible fields.
    * __Incidents fetched per query__: How many incidents will be fetched per query. Caution: high number could create overload. Default is 10.
    * __proxy__: Use system proxy settings
    * __insecure__: Trust any certificate (not secure)
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

In order for the integration to work, the following URLs need to be accessible:

 - For authentication: 
   - `oproxy.demisto.ninja`
   - `api.paloaltonetworks.com `
 - For API requests, one of the following:
   - US: `api.us.cdl.paloaltonetworks.com`
   - EU: `api.nl.cdl.paloaltonetworks.com`

## Fetched Incidents Data
Fetches Firewall threat logs as incidents

## CDL Server - API Calls Caching Mechanism
The integration implements a caching mechanism for repetitive error when requesting access token from CDL server.
When the intgeration reaches the limit of allowed calls, the following error will be shown:

```We have found out that your recent attempts to authenticate against the CDL server have failed. Therefore we have limited the number of calls that the CDL integration performs.```

The integration will re-attempt authentication if the command was called under the following cases:

1. First hour - once every minute.
2. First 48 hours - once in 10 minutes.
3. After that every 60 minutes.

If you wish to try authenticating again, run the 'cdl-reset-authentication-timeout' command and retry.

## Additional Information

---
* In the documented CDL v2, You must now specify the customer's instance ID when you identify the log type that you want to query
against. That is, log types must be fully qualified and the instance ID is a part of the fully qualified name:
`<instanceID>.firewall.traffic`
However in this integration the instance ID is added automatically to the query so the name `firewall.traffic` is a valid table name
* The SQL syntex supported for queries is `csql`
