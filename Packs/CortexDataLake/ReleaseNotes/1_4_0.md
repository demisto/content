The playbook and sub-playbooks query Cortex Data Lake for files, traffic, HTTP requests, and execution flows indicators. Separate searches are conducted for each type of indicator in the playbook. Note that multiple search values should be separated by commas only (without spaces or any special characters). Supported IOCs for this playbook:
  - SHA256.
  - MD5.
  - SHA1.
  - IP Addresses.
  - Geolocation.
  - URLDomain.
  - Port Number.
