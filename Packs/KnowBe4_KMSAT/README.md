# KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KMSAT) Console

Cortex XSOAR is a comprehensive security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform that unifies case management, automation, real-time collaboration, and threat intel management to serve security teams across the incident lifecycle. Cortex XSIAM is a Service Integration and Management (SIAM) platform that combines data from endpoints, network, cloud, and identity systems, so machine learning models can process and understand how the data connects.

This “KnowBe4 KMSAT Event Collector” content pack contains the KMSAT integration, which allows you to send your users' KMSAT security awareness training and simulated phishing data directly to XSOAR and XSIAM.
