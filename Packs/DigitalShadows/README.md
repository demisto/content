## What makes Digital Shadows unique

- Exposure monitoring  
  Digital Shadows monitors for the exposure of these assets across the open, deep, and dark web. This includes code-sharing sites, file-sharing sites, criminal forums, chat messages, social media, and search engines. For additional enrichment and incident response, users can search across many of these sources via "Shadow Search". Furthermore, our Collections and Closed Sources teams focus on continually adding to these sources.

- Risk Identification
  Our technology reduces the mentions of these assets to only those instances that constitute a risk to your business. On average, this combination of technology and human analysis removes more than 95% of the total mentions of an organization's assets. Each alert has a risk score, ensuring your team is not overwhelmed by irrelevant mentions and can easily prioritize alerts.

- Take Action and Protect  
  Alerts provide you all the context you need to make quicker, better decisions. Users also benefit from playbooks for remediating the risk, including the ability to launch takedowns.
