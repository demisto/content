## Relia quest GreyMatter DRP EventCollector Authentication
Requests to all operation endpoints require HTTP Basic authentication, using dedicated (high entropy) API credentials. These normally consist of a six character key, and a 32 character 'secret'. Note that you will not be able to use your normal email/password login details with the HTTP Basic authentication mechanism.

Please contact your Digital Shadows representative to obtain API credentials.

To authenticate the integration, it is required to have username, password and account-id, to get the account-id refer to [here](https://portal-digitalshadows.com/api/stored-objects/portal/searchlight-api-docs/SearchLightAPI_APIKey_AccountId2.pdf)

## Limitations
* The Relia Quest product can return rate-limits when doing too many http-requests, increasing the **Maximum number of events per fetch** parameter to high numbers can cause rate-limits. The integration knows to recover from those rate-limits automatically in some cases, but not in all of them. For more information about rate-limits refer [here](https://portal-digitalshadows.com/learn/searchlight-api/overview/rate-limiting)
