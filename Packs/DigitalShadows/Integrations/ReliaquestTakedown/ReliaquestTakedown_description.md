## ReliaQuest GreyMatter DRP Takedown
Requests to all operation endpoints require HTTP Basic authentication, using dedicated (high entropy) API credentials. These normally consist of a six character key, and a 32 character 'secret'. Note that you will not be able to use your normal email/password login details with the HTTP Basic authentication mechanism.

Contact your ReliaQuest GreyMatter DRP representative to obtain API credentials.

To authenticate the integration, you must have a username, password and account ID. To get the account ID, see [here](https://portal-digitalshadows.com/api/stored-objects/portal/searchlight-api-docs/SearchLightAPI_APIKey_AccountId2.pdf).
