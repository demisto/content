## ReliaQuest GreyMatter DRP Takedown
ReliaQuest's Managed Takedown service provides customers with end-to-end takedown management that quickly removes infringing content, domains, documents and mobile applications. 
 
Working with ReliaQuest's GreyMatter Digital Risk Protection, the Managed Takedown service removes malicious or infringing content from various websites, platforms, stores and domain registrars. Left unresolved, these issues can lead to a loss of revenue, brand damage and loss of customer trust. ReliaQuest removes the burden of takedown management, enabling organizations to easily take swift action that minimizes their digital risk.
