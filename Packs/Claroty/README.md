Effective network security starts with an accurate asset database. The integration between Claroty Continuous Threat Detection (CTD) and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR enables comprehensive IT-OT asset coverage through discovery & enrichment, vulnerability management, and automated threat alerts. Integrating these tools provides coverage through a single-pane-of-glass while eliminating the need for OT-specific monitoring expertise & dedicated tools.

Supporting the broadest list of OT protocols in the industry and multiple asset discovery methodologies, Clarotyâ€™s integration with Cortex XSOAR allows organizations to:
- Identify all OT assets and corresponding asset data to populate the CMDB
- Automate vulnerability management with context-rich playbooks for event resolution
- Threat detection engines identify and parse events to alert Cortex XSOAR for further ticketing and analysis
