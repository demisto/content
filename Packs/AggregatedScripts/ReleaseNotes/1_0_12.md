#### Scripts

##### get-endpoint-data
- Added support for the **using-brand** argument in the **endpoint** command execution. The script now support the list of brands mentioned explicitly in the readme + all integrations containing the **endpoint** command.
- Fixed an issue where the script would return duplicated results for brands that contain both **endpoint** command and a standalone command.
