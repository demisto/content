#### Scripts

##### get-endpoint-data
- Added the **using-brand** argument in the **endpoint** command. The script now runs from the default list of brands in the documentation and brands not from the list with **!endpoint** command.
- Fixed an issue where the script would return duplicated results for brands that contain both **endpoint** command and a standalone command.
