##### New: quarantine-file

Added the **quarantine-file** script, which executes the ***quarantine-file*** command on a specified file via the appropriate agent. 
This script is used to isolate files identified as suspicious. The integration used to perform the quarantine action is selected either by user input (the *brands* argument) or based on the available configured instances.
