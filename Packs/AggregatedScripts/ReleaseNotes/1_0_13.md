#### Scripts

##### get-endpoint-data
- Added the *using-brand* argument in the ***endpoint*** command. The script now runs from the default list of brands in the documentation and brands not from the list with ***endpoint*** command.
- Fixed an issue where the script returned duplicate results for brands that contain the ***endpoint*** command.
