- name: external_enrichment
  description: |
    Whether to call external integrations for enrichment.
    - 'true': enrich using enabled external integrations (e.g., CIRCL CVE Search, CVE Search v2).
    - 'false': use only existing TIM data; skip external integrations.
    If the 'brands' argument is provided, this flag is ignored and enrichment is run only on the brands provided.

  description: Whether to retrieve a human-readable entry for every command; if false, only the final result is summarized and error entries are suppressed.

- name: brands
  description: |
    A list of integration brands to run enrichment against.  
    Example: `"CIRCL CVE Search, CVE Search v2"`.  
    - If provided, only the selected brands are used. 
    - If left empty, the script runs enrichment on all enabled integrations,
      depending on the `external_enrichment` flag.
    To see the available brands for the `cve` command, run: `!ProvidesCommand command=cve`.
  isArray: true
  required: false
- name: additional_fields
  description: |
    When set to true, the output will also include an `AdditionalFields` object
    for each of the indicator result.  
    `AdditionalFields` contains all fields returned by TIM or the integrations
    that are not part of the standard output keys: `ID`, `Brand`, `CVSS`, 
    `Description`, `Published`, `CVSS`.  
    When set to false, only the standard keys are returned.

comment: This script gathers CVE reputation data from multiple integrations and returns a "CVEEnrichment" object with consolidated information to the context output.
