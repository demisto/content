| Script Type | python3 |
| Cortex XSOAR Version | 6.10.0 |

## Inputs

---

| **Argument Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| file_hash | Hash of the file. Supported types are: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. For multiple values, provide a comma-separated list of file hashes. |
| enrichment_brands | Integrations brands to use for running external enrichment. If not provided, the command will run for all available integrations that implement the file reputation command.<br/>For multiple values, provide a comma-separated list of integration IDs. For example: "VirusTotal \(API v3\),WildFire-v2, Cortex Core - IR". Specifying enrichment_brands will force enable external_enrichment. |
| verbose | Whether to retrieve a human-readable entry for every command. When set to false, human-readable will only summarize the final result and suppress error entries from commands. Default is false. |
| external_enrichment | Whether to run additional external indicator enrichment commands. Set to true to enrich with information from the specified source brands. If set to false, only existing indicators in the Threat Intelligence Module \(TIM\) will be retrieved. Default is false. |
| additional_fields | Whether to return unmapped \(secondary\) fields to the context output under the "FileEnrichment.AdditionalFields" path. Default is false. |
