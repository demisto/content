    A comma-seperated list of brands you want to run get-endpoint-data for. If not provided, the get-endpoint-data script will run for the list of supported default brands. Example: 'Active Directory Query v2,FireEyeHX v2'.
    Default supported brands are:
    - 'Active Directory Query v2'
    - 'McAfee ePO v2'
    - 'CrowdstrikeFalcon'
    - 'Cortex XDR - IR'
    - 'Cortex Core - IR'
    - 'FireEyeHX v2'
    If you provide a list of brands, only those brands will be executed and not the default list.
    If you include a brand that is not on the default list, the script will run the !endpoint command on it.
    If you do not provide any brand, the predefined list of default brands and the !endpoint command will automatically run on all brands.
