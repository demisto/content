<h3>Guide</h3>
<span>
The automation is most useful in a playbook to determine the outcome of a conditional task - which will be one of the provided options.
It uses a mechanism that allows external users to respond in Demisto(per investigation) with entitlement strings embedded within the message contents.

<br>
The automation can utilize the interactive capabilities of Slack to send a form with buttons - 
this requires the external endpoint for interactive responses to be available for connection (See the Slack v2 intergation documentation for more information).
You can also utilize threads instead, simply by specifying the <code>responseType</code> argument.
