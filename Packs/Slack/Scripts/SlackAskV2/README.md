## Guide
---
The automation is most useful in a playbook to determine the outcome of a conditional task - which will be one of the provided options.
It uses a mechanism that allows external users to respond in Cortex XSOAR (per investigation) with entitlement strings embedded within the message contents.
![SlackAsk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35098543/66044107-7de39f00-e529-11e9-8099-049502b4d62f.png)

The automation can utilize the interactive capabilities of Slack to send a form with buttons - 
this requires the external endpoint for interactive responses to be available for connection (See the SlackV3 integration documentation for more information).
You can also utilize threads instead, simply by specifying the `responseType` argument.

## Notes
---
- When using the `replyEntriesTag` argument, the `persistent` argument must be set to `True`.
- `SlackAskV2` will not work when run in the playbook debugger. This is because the debugger does not generate entitlements, since they must be tied to an investigation. Entitlements are needed to track the response.
