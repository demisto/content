SlackBlockBuilder will format a given Slack block into a format readable by the SlackV3 integration. The script will also send the block to the given destination.

The Slack Block Kit Builder can be found [here](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder).

## Script Data
---

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Script Type | python3 |
| Tags | slack |
| Cortex XSOAR Version | 6.2.0 |

## Use Case
---
This automation allows you to send a survey to users (including external to Cortex XSOAR) via Slack, and have them respond and 
reflect the answer back to Cortex XSOAR. Within the survey, you can use all the different input types that are available 
via the Slack Block Kit, including buttons, text fields, datepickers, radio buttons, multi select, and more.

See this [blog post](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/security-operations/playbook-of-the-week-teaching-xsoar-a-few-new-tricks-with-slack-blocks/) for more detailed use case information and ideas.

## Dependencies
---
Requires an instance of the Slack v3 integration.

This script uses the following commands and scripts.
* send-notification

### Setup Requirements
1. In order to use **SlackBlockBuilder**, you must enter an API key created by a default admin user (username **admin** by default) into the Slack v3 integration instance settings. The API key must be generated by default admin, not just any user.

2. Ensure the "Long running instance" checkbox is checked in the Slack v3 integration instance settings.

| lifetime | Time until the question expires. For example - 1 day. When it expires, a default response is sent. |
| defaultResponse | Default response in case the question expires. |
| slackInstance | The instance of SlackV3 this script should use. |

## Outputs
---

| **Path** | **Description** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SlackBlockState | The State of the response from the user will be stored under this context path. | unknown |

**Note**
Make sure to configure the "XSOAR API Key" instance parameter in the "Slack v3" integration. 

To get the API Key:
1. Go to **Settings** -> **API keys**.
2. Click **Get Your Key**.
3. Type a name for the key and click **Generate key**.
4. Copy and paste the key in the instance parameter.
#### Command Example using blocks_url

## Troubleshooting
---
**Issue**: The survey message is not sent to Slack.

**Troubleshooting**: Test the `send-notification` command on its own to verify it is working correctly. This will provide a more specific error message if there is an issue. Note that the Slack API bot you set up for the Slack v3 integration needs to be added to any channels you want to send SlackBlockBuilder surveys to.

Verify your Slack blocks payload is valid. Try simplifying the payload. Test with a simple dummy payload like the following:
```
{
	"blocks": [
		{
			"type": "section",
			"text": {
				"type": "plain_text",
				"text": "hello world",
				"emoji": true
			}
		}
	]
}
```
---
**Issue**: The survey is sent to Slack and submitted successfully, but the response does not show up in context data in Cortex XSOAR.

**Troubleshooting**: The most likely cause is that there is no API key entered into the Slack v3 integration instance settings, or the API key was not created by default admin. Ensure an API key created by a default admin user is entered into the Slack v3 integration instance settings.

---
**Issue**: The survey is sent to Slack successfully, but clicking the Submit button in Slack does nothing. No response is returned to Cortex XSOAR. There may be a ⚠️ icon next to the Submit button in Slack. 

**Troubleshooting**: Ensure the "Long running instance" checkbox is checked in the Slack v3 integration instance settings.
