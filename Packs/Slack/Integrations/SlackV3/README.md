This integration was integrated and tested with Slack.
## Configure SlackV3 on Cortex XSOAR

Slack V3 utilizes "Socket Mode" to enable the integration to communicate directly with Slack for mirroring. This requires a dedicated Slack app to be created for the XSOAR integration.


1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for SlackV3.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `bot_token` | Slack API bot token. | False |
    | `app_token` | Slack API app token. | False |
    | `incidentNotificationChannel` | Dedicated Slack channel to receive notifications. | False |
    | `notify_incidents` | Send notifications about incidents to the dedicated channel. | False |
    | `min_severity` | Minimum incident severity to send messages to Slack by. | False |
    | `incidentType` | Type of incidents created in Slack. | False |
    | `allow_incidents` | Allow external users to create incidents via direct messages. | False |
    | `proxy` | Use system proxy settings. | False |
    | `unsecure` | Trust any certificate (not secure). | False |
    | `longRunning` | Long running instance. Required for investigation mirroring and direct messages. | False |
    | `bot_name` | Bot display name in Slack (Cortex XSOAR by default). | False |
    | `bot_icon` | Bot icon in Slack - Image URL (Cortex XSOAR icon by default). | False |
    | `max_limit_time` | Maximum time to wait for a rate limiting call in seconds. | False |
    | `paginated_count` | Number of objects to return in each paginated call. | False |
    | `proxy_url` | Proxy URL to use in Slack API calls. | False |
    | `filtered_tags` | Comma-separated list of tags by which to filter the messages sent from XSOAR. Only supported in Cortex XSOAR V6.1 and above. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

### Creating a Custom App
1. Navigate to the following [link](https://api.slack.com/apps/).
 2. Click **Create an App**.
 3. Click **From scratch**.
 4. Enter an *App Name* and select the workspace in which your app will reside.
 5. Click **Create App**. 
 6. Click **Socket Mode** found on the left-hand side of the menu. 
 7. Click **Enable Socket Mode**. This will create an app level token with the required scope for connecting. 
 8. Enter a name for the token.
 9. Click **Generate**.

You will receive a token starting with `xapp`. Copy this token and use it for the `app_token` parameter when creating an instance of the integration.

### Defining Events
For Slack V3 to be able to mirror incidents, you must enable the Events feature. 
1. Navigate to *Event Subscriptions* found under the Features menu. 
2. Enable Events by clicking the toggle switch.
 
Enabling the Events API will present various events that the app may subscribe to. Currently, Slack V3 only uses the following message events:
 
 | Event Name | What it's used for |
 | --- | --- |
 | `message.channel` | Allows the app to receive 

| **Event Name** | **What it's used for** |
| --- | --- |
| `message.channel` | Allows the app to receive messages which were posted in a channel. Used for Mirror In. |
| `message.mpim` | Allows the app to receive messages which were posted to a group. Used for Mirror In. |
| `message.groups` | Allows the app to receive messages which were posted to a private channel. Used for Mirror In. |
| `message.im` | Allows the app to receive direct messages. |

These message events are available for both "Bot Events" and "Events on behalf of users". In order to use mirroring and handle bot questions, Cortex XSOAR recommends enabling these event scopes for both bot and user events.

### OAuth Scopes

In order to utilize the full functionality of the Slack integration, Cortex XSOAR recommends the following OAuth scopes for the bot token:

| **OAuth Scope** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:history` | View messages and other content in public channels that the app has been added to. |
| `channels:read` | View basic information about public channels in a workspace. |
| `chat:write` | Send messages as the bot. |
| `files:write` | Upload, edit, and delete files as the bot. |
| `groups:history` | View messages and other content in private channels that the bot has been added to. |
| `groups:read` | View basic information about private channels that the bot has been added to. |
| `im:history` | View messages and other content in direct messages that the bot has been added to. |
| `im:read` | View basic information about direct messages that the bot has been added to. |
| `mpim:history` | View messages and other content in group direct messages that the bot has been added to. |
| `mpim:read` | View basic information about group direct messages that the bot has been added to |
| `users:read` | View people in a workspace. |

The app token requires the `connections:write` scope in order to open the socket connection and is required for the Events and Questions functionality. It's important to note that when configuring Socket Mode, this scope will automatically be created for you.

## Backwards Compatibility with Slack V2
Slack V3 currently contains improvements to enhance the stability of the integration as well as the circumvention of OProxy. This version is intended to provide customers with more granular control over the Slack integration by enabling the Bring-Your-Own-App model and customizable scope-based authentication.

All commands are fully compatible with Slack V2 playbooks as their inputs and outputs have remained the same. As a customer, you should notice no significant change in the behavior of the Slack integration with your existing playbooks.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
