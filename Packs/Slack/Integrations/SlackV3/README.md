Send messages and notifications to your Slack team.
This integration was integrated and tested with Slack.

## Configure SlackV3 on Cortex XSOAR

Slack V3 utilizes ["Socket Mode"](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) to enable the integration to
communicate directly with Slack for mirroring. This requires a dedicated Slack app to be created for the Cortex XSOAR
integration. See [Creating a Custom App](#creating-a-custom-app) on how to create your App in Slack.

Refer to
the [video tutorial](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/cortex-xsoar-how-to-videos/cortex-xsoar-how-to-video-slack-v3-configuration/ta-p/445226)
to learn about configuring SlackV3 using the app manifest.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for SlackV3.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    |---|---|---|
    | `bot_token` | Slack API bot token. | False |
    | `user_token` | Slack API user token. | False |
    | `app_token` | Slack API app token. | False |
    | `incidentNotificationChannel` | Dedicated Slack channel to receive notifications. | False |
    | `min_severity` | Minimum incident severity by which to send messages to Slack. | False |
    | `incidentType` | Type of incidents created in Slack. | False |
    | `allow_incidents` | Allow external users to create incidents via direct messages. | False |
    | `proxy` | Use system proxy settings. | False |
    | `unsecure` | Trust any certificate (not secure). | False |
    | `longRunning` | Long running instance. Required for investigation mirroring and direct messages. | False |
    | `bot_name` | Bot display name in Slack (Cortex XSOAR by default). | False |
    | `bot_icon` | Bot icon in Slack - Image URL (Cortex XSOAR icon by default). | False |
    | `max_limit_time` | Maximum time to wait for a rate limiting call in seconds. | False |
    | `paginated_count` | Number of objects to return in each paginated call. | False |
    | `proxy_url` | Proxy URL to use in Slack API calls. | False |
    | `filtered_tags` | Comma-separated list of tags by which to filter the messages sent from Cortex XSOAR. Only supported in Cortex XSOAR V6.1 and above. | False |
    | `permitted_notifications` | Types of notifications to send (to individual users and to the dedicated Slack channel, if specified). | False |
    | `common_channels` | For workspaces where a handful of channels are consistently being used, you may add them as a CSV in the format ChannelName:ChannelID. | False |
    | `disable_caching` | When configured, Disable Caching will prevent the integration from paginating to search for Users or Conversations. Additionally, it will prevent excess data from being stored to the integration context. If this parameter is disabled, the instance may create high memory usage. | False |
    | `mirroring` | Enable Incident Mirroring. | False |
    | `ignore_event_retries` | In some cases, events may not be processed fast enough. If you wish to attempt to retry the event, select `false`. Note that this can result in some responses being double-posted. Default is `True`. | False |
    | `extensive_logging` | Extensive Logging. This parameter will write additional data to the logs and should only be used when you are directed to by XSOAR support. | False |

5. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

### Caching

When the `Disable Caching of Users and Channels` parameter is configured, there are no pagination calls made to Slack.
This is to avoid rate limiting which can occur in workspaces where there are excessive amounts of channels or users. If
there were no timeout issues with running commands on your environment prior to pack version 2.3.0, there is no direct
need to enable this mode.

Additionally. with the `Common Channels` parameter configured, channels and their IDs found in this parameter will be
accessible to the integration to use while caching is disabled.

#### Finding a Channel ID

`Common Channels` follows the format, `First ChannelName:FirstChannelID, Second ChannelName:SecondChannelID`. To find
the channel ID for the channels that are frequently used:

1. Navigate to the channel you want to retrieve an ID for.
2. Click the name of the channel.

   On the bottom of the presented menu, the channel ID can be found.

Channel IDs typically follow the format `C` + an alphanumeric string.

## Backwards Compatibility with Slack V2

Slack V3 contains improvements to enhance the stability of the integration as well as the circumvention of OProxy. This
version is intended to provide customers with more granular control over the Slack integration by enabling the
Bring-Your-Own-App model and customizable scope-based authentication.

All commands are fully compatible with Slack V2 playbooks as their inputs and outputs have remained the same. As a
customer, you should notice no significant change in the behavior of the Slack integration with your existing playbooks.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### Known Limitations

- All commands which use `channel` as a parameter, it is now advised to use `channel-id` using the channel ID found in
  the incident's context under the `Slack.Channels.ID` value. Using `channel-id` as opposed to `channel` will improve
  the performance of the integration.
- SlackV3 mirrors incidents by listening to messages being sent in channels the bot has been added to.
  Because of this, you may have some users in Slack who are not users in Cortex XSOAR. This will occasionally cause the
  module
  health to indicate that an error has occurred because a user was unable to be found. In this circumstance, the error
  is expected and is purely cosmetic in nature.
- In some cases when mirroring an investigation, kicking the admin will cause no further actions to be able to be
  performed by the bot. Any subsequent actions taken on the channel (such as mirror out) will result in a "not in
  channel" error.
- Note: If a dedicated channel is configured, however there are no notifications being sent, verify that the *Types of
  Notifications* to send parameter is populated.
- ***mirror-investigation*** will only mirror chat messages between XSOAR and Slack. Images, threads, and files are not
  supported at this tme.
