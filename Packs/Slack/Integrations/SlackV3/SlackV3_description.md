Slack V3 utilizes "Socket Mode" to enable the integration to communicate directly with Slack for mirroring. 
This requires a dedicated Slack app to be created for the XSOAR integration. For instructions on how to create and configure your custom Slack app, please review the documentation found [here](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/slack-v3).

Note: This is a beta Integration, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the integration is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the integration during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the integration to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.
