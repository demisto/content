Slack V3 utilizes "Socket Mode" to enable the integration to communicate directly with Slack for mirroring. 
This requires a dedicated Slack app to be created for the XSOAR integration. For instructions on how to create and configure your custom Slack app, please review the documentation found [here](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/slack-v3).
