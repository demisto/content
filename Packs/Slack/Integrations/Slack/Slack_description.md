### Slack (Deprecated)
***Deprecated. Use the Slack v3 integration instead.***

To allow us access to Slack, the Cortex XSOAR app has to be added to the relevant workspace. Do so by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/slack).
 After adding the Cortex XSOAR app, you will get an Access Token and Bot Token, which should be inserted in the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.
