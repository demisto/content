#### Integrations
##### Slack v3
- Fixed an issue where events were not processed quickly enough when the socket connection is under a heavy load.
- Logging in the Extensive Logging mode is now buffered to increase performance.
- Fixed an issue where the integration health status would quickly flicker between an error and healthy.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/slackv3:1.0.0.42960*.
