#### Integrations

##### Slack v3

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/slackv3:1.0.0.5301537*.

- ***Breaking Change:*** In ***slack-get-conversation-history*** command, the *conversation_id* argument was incorrectly named and functioned as a timestamp filter, retrieving the first message after the specified time. This argument has been updated to properly accept the conversation ID of a Slack channel or direct message to get history from.

- Added support for the following arguments in the ***slack-get-conversation-history*** command:
  - *conversation_name* - used to retrieve conversation history by channel name or user name in case of DMs.
  - *from_time* - used to retrieve messages from a specific timestamp (maps to "oldest" parameter in Slack API).

- Deprecated *channel_id* argument.
