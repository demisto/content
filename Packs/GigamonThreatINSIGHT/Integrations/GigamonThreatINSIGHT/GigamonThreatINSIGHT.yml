  # Gigamon Insight Integration for Cortex XSOAR

  ### Insight Overview
  Gigamon Insight is a cloud-based network detection and response solution built for the rapid detection of threat activity, investigation of suspicious behavior, proactive hunting for potential risks, and directing a fast and effective response to active threats.

  ### Integration Overview
  The Gigamon Insight Cortex XSOAR integration enables security teams to utilize the features and functionality of the Insight solution with their existing Cortex XSOAR deployment. The integration leverages Insight’s fully RESTful APIs to interact with the Insight backend to introduce specific data sets into Cortex XSOAR. This document contains all the necessary information to configure, install, and use the integration.

  For more information about the Cortex XSOAR integration visit the Insight help documentation here: https://insight.gigamon.com/help/api/apidocs-demisto

  #### Installation

  To install the integration:
  1. Navigate to the Settings section of the Cortex XSOAR interface. Ensure you are on the Integration tab and Servers & Services sub-tab. In the Search box, type “Gigamon Insight” to search for the integration.

      Alternatively, you can manually install the integration using the integration-Gigamon_Insight.yml file available on Cortex XSOAR’s GitHub repository (here). Once you have the file downloaded, select the Upload button on the Settings page

  2. Click the Add Instance link to create a new instance of the add-on.
  3. In the settings, enter a Name for the instance, and a valid Insight API Key. (in the Insight portal, navigate to the Profile Settings page to create a new API key).

      Optional - Select the Fetches Incidents option to have the integration periodically pull new detections from Insight into Cortex XSOAR. Note: This will pull ALL events your portal account has access to unless you specify a specific account UUID.

  4. Choose either Use Single Engine or Use Load-Balancing Group depending on your Cortex XSOAR deployment.
  5. Click the Test button to test the instance. If the instance can connect to the Insight APIs, you should see a successful message like the one above.
  6. Lastly, click the Done button to complete the installation of the integration.

  #### Commands

  The integration includes several commands available to execute within Cortex XSOAR to interact with Gigamon Insight. Below is a list of all the commands and the following sections detail the arguments for each command.
