Trickbot is generally delivered by spam campaigns via malicious Microsoft Office documents. Trickbot attempts to harvest credentials for web sites, primarily for financial institutions. As well as gathering credentials for any user accounts used on affected hosts, it can also be used as a backdoor which enables access to the network. \n\nGigamon ATR considers this detection to be high severity, as it is indicative of successful malicious code execution and allows for unauthorized access to the network. Gigamon ATR considers this detection to be high confidence due to the uniqueness of the user agent used in HTTP requests by the trojan. \n\n## Next Steps \n1. Determine if this is a true positive by: \n    1. Investigating for connections outbound to ports 447 and 449 from the affected host.\n    2. Checking the affected host for earlier executable downloads with no user agent set, or connectivity checks such as public IP lookups (e.g. HTTP requests to checkip.amazonaws.com).\n    3. Checking the impacted asset for other indicators of compromise. Persistence is generally achieved via a scheduled task. \n3. Quarantine the impacted device. \n4.

This detection is considered moderate confidence, as it may coincidentally match similar traffic from uncommon devices or scanners.\n\n### Next Steps\n1.

Malicious files are often hosted in the root folder of web servers to enable ease of use for threat actors. However, the transfer of a malicious executable does not necessarily indicate that an attacker has achieved privileged code execution. For example, some exploit kits deliver executable payloads regardless of whether the exploit succeeded.\n\nGigamon ATR considers this activity high severity due to its historical use in both targeted and un-targeted attacks. Gigamon ATR considers this detection low confidence because, while rare, some legitimate services host executable binaries from the root of the web hosting directory.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Determine if this detection is a true positive by:\n   1. Checking that the event is not downloading a benign file from a reputable domain. If the domain is reputable, and the resource name is thematically consistent, the detection could be a false positive or a well concealed attack using a compromised domain.\n   2. Verifying that the file is malicious in nature.\n2. Quarantine the impacted device.\n3. Begin incident response procedures on the impacted device.\n4. Block traffic to attacker infrastructure.\n5.

Certain domain services require that a domain account is associated to them via a Service Principle Name (SPN). Any authenticated domain user can request a TGS ticket for accounts with an SPN set and if that ticket is encrypted with ciphers such as RC4, the service's password hash may be vulnerable to an offline brute force attack.\r\n\r\nKerberoasting attacks often involve an adversary requesting tickets for many of these service accounts in hopes that one of them uses a weak password.\r\n\r\nGigamon ATR considers activity indicative of active compromise to be high severity. Gigamon ATR considers this detection moderate confidence because certain instances may be normal domain activity.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n1. Review the services requested and determine if an SPN should be set for a given account.\r\n2. Ensure that service accounts have strong passwords.\r\n3.

Any authenticated domain user can request a TGS ticket for accounts with an SPN set and if that ticket is encrypted with ciphers such as RC4, the service's password hash may be vulnerable to an offline brute force attack.<br/><br/>Kerberoasting attacks often involve an adversary requesting tickets for many of these service accounts in hopes that one of them uses a weak password.<br/><br/>Gigamon ATR considers activity indicative of active compromise to be high severity.
