# Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT Integration for Cortex XSOAR

## Insight Overview

The Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT Demisto integration enables security teams to utilize the features and functionality of the ThreatINSIGHT solution with their existing Demisto deployment. The integration leverages ThreatINSIGHT RESTful APIs to interact with the back end to introduce specific data sets into Demisto. This document contains all the necessary information to configure, install, and use the integration.

## Integration Overview

The Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT Cortex XSOAR integration enables security teams to utilize the features and functionality of the Insight solution with their existing Cortex XSOAR deployment. The integration leverages Insightâ€™s fully RESTful APIs to interact with the Insight backend to introduce specific data sets into Cortex XSOAR. This document contains all the necessary information to configure, install, and use the integration.
For more information about the Cortex XSOAR integration visit the Insight help documentation here: https://insight.gigamon.com/help/api/apidocs-demisto

## Configure Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Instances**.
2. Search for **Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT**.
3. Click the Add Instance link to create a new instance of the add-on.
In the settings, enter a Name for the instance, and a valid Insight API Key. (in the Insight portal, navigate to the Profile Settings page to create a new API key).
Optional - Select the Fetches Incidents option to have the integration periodically pull new detections from Insight into Cortex XSOAR. Note: This will pull ALL events your portal account has access to unless you specify a specific account UUID.
4. Choose either Use Single Engine or Use Load-Balancing Group depending on your Cortex XSOAR deployment.
5. Click the Test button to test the instance. If the instance can connect to the Insight APIs, you should see a successful message like the one above.
6. Lastly, click the Done button to complete the installation of the integration.
