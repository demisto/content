The Threat Intelligence Reports pack gives the user a rich text creation and editing experience. The pack allows the user to publish the report within XSOAR to different roles as well as exporting it to PDF format with a push of a button.

The pack comes with 5 out of the box report templates for easier use:
1. Executive Brief
2. Campaign Report
3. Threat Actor Report
4. Malware Report
5. Vulnerability Report

The user may also add relationships to indicators via a special Relationships section in order to add additional data to the report. Markdown is supported in the report body allowing the user to add tables, images, change the color of the font or background and much more.
