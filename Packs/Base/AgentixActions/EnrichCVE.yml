description: |
  A comprehensive action to enrich the provided CVE indicator and retrieve all available data.
  The results include both tenant-specific internal information (from the Threat Intelligence Management (TIM) brand) and global threat intelligence.
  Global threat intelligence is retrieved using configured integrations to identify potential threats.
  ACTION REDUNDANCY WARNING: Due to its comprehensive nature, DO NOT use 'EnrichIndicator' or 'CortexListIndicators' in parallel with this action, as the data is already included in the output.
  PREREQUISITE: Ensure that one or more of these external integrations are configured in your environment.
