##### SanePdfReports
- Added support for automatic page breaks in reports:
    - Charts will now automatically drop to a new page (including the header) if there is not enough space in the current page.
    - Table rows and section fields will now drop to a new page in order to prevent text from spliting between pages.
    - When a table widget will span across several pages, the column's header will repeat in each page.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/sane-pdf-reports:1.0.0.18186*.
