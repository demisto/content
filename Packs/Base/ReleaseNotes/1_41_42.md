##### CommonServerPython

- Updated the `CommonServerPython` script with a time-sensitive command timeout strategy in `BaseClient`. This strategy enforces a strict execution time limit (default 15 seconds) for commands when the indicator extraction mode is `inline` by dynamically adjusting API timeouts and disabling retries. For more information, see the [indicator extraction modes documentation](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/8/Cortex-XSOAR-SaaS-Documentation/Indicator-extraction-modes).
