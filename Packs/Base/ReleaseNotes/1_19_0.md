#### Scripts
##### CommonServerPython
- Added the *execute_commands* function for executing multiple commands.
- Added an option to create a generic CommandRunner for a script that wraps several commands from different integrations.  
  See [CommandRunner Documentation] (https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/code-conventions#CommandRunner).
