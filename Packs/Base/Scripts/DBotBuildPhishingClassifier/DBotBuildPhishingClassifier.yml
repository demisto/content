- description: The field name with the label. Supports a comma-separated list, the first non-empty value will be taken.
  name: tagField
  required: true
- defaultValue: '15'
  description: Sample text of which the total number of words are less than or equal to this number will be ignored.

  description: 'A comma-separated list of email tags values and mapping. The script considers only the tags specified in this field. You can map a label to another value by using this format: LABEL:MAPPED_LABEL. For example, for 4 values in email tag: malicious, credentials harvesting, inner communitcation, external legit email, unclassified. While training, we want to ignore "unclassified" tag, and refer to "credentials harvesting" as "malicious" too. Also, we want to merge "inner communitcation" and "external legit email" to one tag called "non-malicious". The input will be: malicious, credentials harvesting:malicious, inner communitcation:non-malicious, external legit email:non-malicious'
  name: phishingLabels
- defaultValue: emailsubject
  description: Incident field name with the email subject.
  name: emailsubject
- defaultValue: emailbody
  description: Incident field name with the email body (text).
  name: emailbody
- defaultValue: emailbodyhtml
  description: Incident field name with the email body (html).
  name: emailbodyhtml
- auto: PREDEFINED
  defaultValue: Any
  description: The language of the input text. Default is "Any". Can be "Any", "English", "German", "French", "Spanish", "Portuguese", "Italian", "Dutch", or "Other". If "Any"  or "Other" is selected, the script preprocess the entire input, no matter what its acutual language is. If a specific language is selected, the script filters out any other language from the output text.
  name: language
  predefined:
  - Any
  - English
  - German
  - French

  - Dutch
  - Other
- auto: PREDEFINED
  defaultValue: auto
  description: The training algorithm to use for training the model. Default is "auto". If "auto" is selected, the training algorithm will be chosen automatically based on the number of incidents per each label. Use "from_scratch" to train a new model from scratch, based on your incidents only. In general, "from_scratch" will perform better where the number of incidents is high (500 incidents or more per each verdict). "fine-tune" trains a model based on the out-of-the-box model. "fine-tune" will perform better when the number of incidents is relatively low. It's possible to train multiple models using different algorithms options, and compare their results.
