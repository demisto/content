  Searches past similar issues based on issue fields' similarity. Includes an option to also display indicators similarity.
  Note: For the similarity calculation, at least one field must be provided in one of the "text_similarity_fields", "json_similarity_fields", "discrete_match_fields" or "use_all_fields" arguments.
