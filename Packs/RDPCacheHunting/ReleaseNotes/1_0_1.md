#### Playbooks

##### New: RDP Bitmap Cache - Detect and Hunt

- New: ## Playbook: Automated Collection and Forensic Analysis of RDP Sessions Cache Data

This playbook automates the collection and forensic analysis of RDP sessions cache data. It involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Collect Cache Files and Convert to Image

The first step is to collect the cache files from RDP sessions and convert them into an image format.

### Step 2: Extract Readable Text from the Image

Once the cache files are converted into an image, the playbook extracts readable text from the image to facilitate analysis.

### Step 3: Build Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from Text

In this step, the extracted text is used to build indicators of compromise (IOCs) for further investigation and threat hunting.

### Step 4: Enrich Extracted Indicators for Further Hunting

Finally, the playbook enriches the extracted indicators by adding additional context and information, enhancing their usefulness for further hunting and analysis.

> Note: It is important to customize and adapt this playbook to fit specific use cases and environments. Additionally, ensure compliance with legal and privacy requirements when collecting and analyzing data.

Feel free to modify and enhance this playbook according to your requirements.
