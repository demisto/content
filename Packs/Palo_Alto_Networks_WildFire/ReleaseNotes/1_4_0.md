##### Palo Alto Networks WildFire v2
Added the *polling* argument to the following commands:
- ***wildfire-upload*** 
- ***wildfire-upload-url*** 
- ***wildfire-upload-file-remote***
- ***wildfire-upload-file-url*** 
When *polling* is set to true, the command will try to return the results.
The *polling* argument enables users to search WildFire using a single command, that doesn't require **GenericPolling Playbook**.
