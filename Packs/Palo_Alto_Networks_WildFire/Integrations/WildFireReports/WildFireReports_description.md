This integration is set up by default on Cortex XSOAR versions 6.5+ with the Threat Intel Module (TIM). It is designed for internal use with the TIM Sample Analysis feature. To run ad hoc CLI commands to generate WildFire reports, use the Palo Alto Networks WildFire v2 integration instead.

#### How to retrieve a Palo Alto Networks WildFire Reports API key

Note: If you have a TIM license that is up-to-date and are running Cortex XSOAR version 6.5, you do not need to set up an API key.
The required information is automatically retrieved from your Cortex XSOAR TIM license. 
This API key is used in the *API Key* field in the integration configuration.

1. Navigate to your [WildFire Account](https://wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com/wildfire/account).
2. Log in to your *WildFire* account.
3. Select the *Account* tab from the menu.
4. Copy the API key.
