#### Playbooks

##### OpenCTI Create Indicator

Updated to use the new indicator commands.

**NOTE**: ***This version will break backwards compatibility*** as it introduces terminology alignment between **OpenCTI** and its integration.
- Former **indicator** commands have been upgraded with new logic to align with **OpenCTI** indicators.
- **indicator** commands are now **observable** commands to align with **OpenCTI** observables.
- Make sure to update any Playbooks or Scripts that use the modified commands.
