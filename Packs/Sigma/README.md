# Sigma

#### Overview

The Sigma Detection Rules content pack provides an integration with Sigma, a generic and open signature format for SIEM systems. This content pack enables you to create, manage, and utilize Sigma detection rules within Cortex XSOAR. Sigma rules allow you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward and universal format, which can be easily converted to SIEM-specific queries.

#### What does this pack do?

This new pack enables you to import Sigma rules either via a string or by a file into the Cortex XSOAR TIM. Once in the system you can use the built-in scripts to convert the newly added rules into the format of your choice and use it to query 3rd party security products.

#### Content delivered with the content pack

- An additional Cortex XSOAR indicator type called "Sigma Rule".
- All the relevant fields needed to store the data of the "Sigma Rule" indicator.
- A new layout for the newly added indicator type.
- Utility scripts needed to import Sigma rules and export them in the user chosen format.
