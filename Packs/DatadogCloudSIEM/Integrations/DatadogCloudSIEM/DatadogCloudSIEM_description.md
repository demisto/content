## Datadog Cloud SIEM

Datadog Cloud SIEM elevates organizations’ threat detection and investigation for dynamic, cloud-scale environments.

With Datadog Cloud SIEM, you can augment your existing SIEM investments and deliver better cloud security outcomes. Datadog Cloud SIEM analyzes operational and security logs in real time—regardless of their volume—while utilizing curated, out-of-the-box integrations and rules to detect threats and investigate them. Developers, security, and operations teams can also leverage detailed observability data to accelerate security investigations in a single, unified platform.

The Datadog Cloud SIEM integration for Palo Alto XSOAR streamlines security operations by unifying signal and case management. Teams can retrieve and manage Datadog security signals directly in XSOAR, automate triage, and maintain a consistent investigation view across both platforms.
