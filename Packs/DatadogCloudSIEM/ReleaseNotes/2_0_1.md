#### Integrations

##### Datadog Cloud SIEM
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/datadog-api-client:1.0.0.4893383*.


- Updated the **Datadog Cloud SIEM** integration to focus exclusively on Cloud SIEM functionality. The integration now correctly maps **Datadog Cloud SIEM Security Signals** to XSOAR incidents instead of Datadog Incident Management incidents, aligning with proper SIEM integration patterns. **Note:** This is a breaking change - users of version 1.x must reconfigure the integration to use security signals instead of incidents and update any playbooks or automations that depend on removed commands.
- Deprecated the following commands to maintain product focus on Cloud SIEM:
  - ***datadog-event-create*** and ***datadog-event-list*** (Events API)
  - ***datadog-tag-list***, ***datadog-host-tag-create***, ***datadog-host-tag-get***, ***datadog-host-tag-update***, and ***datadog-host-tag-delete*** (Tags/Hosts API)
  - ***datadog-active-metric-list***, ***datadog-metric-search***, ***datadog-metric-metadata-get***, ***datadog-metric-metadata-update***, and ***datadog-time-series-point-query*** (Metrics API)
  - ***datadog-incident-create***, ***datadog-incident-delete***, ***datadog-incident-update***, and ***datadog-incident-list*** (Incident Management API)
- Added support for **Security Signals API** with full CRUD operations through the following commands:
  - ***datadog-signal-get*** - Retrieve a specific security signal by ID
  - ***datadog-signal-list*** - List and filter security signals with advanced query support
  - ***datadog-signal-update*** - Update security signal *assignee* and *triage state* (open, under_review, archived)
  - ***datadog-signal-comment-add*** - Add comments to security signals for collaboration and documentation
  - ***datadog-signal-comment-list*** - List all comments on a security signal
- Added support for **Security Rules API** through the following commands:
  - ***datadog-rule-get*** - Retrieve detailed information about a specific security rule
  - ***datadog-rule-suppress*** - Suppress a security rule with optional data exclusion queries
  - ***datadog-rule-unsuppress*** - Remove suppression from a security rule
- Added the ***datadog-logs-query*** command for security investigations and threat hunting.
- You can now automatically fetch security signals as XSOAR incidents with configurable filters including *severity* (info, low, medium, high, critical), *state* (open, under_review, archived), custom query filters using Datadog search syntax, automatic severity mapping to XSOAR severity levels, and configurable fetch time range and limits.
- Improved implementation with modern dataclass architecture for type safety and maintainability, comprehensive context outputs for all security signal fields (*triage state*, *assignee*, *rule details*), support for Datadog's native search syntax in query parameters, pagination support with configurable limits, enhanced error handling and validation, and full support for security signal triage workflows.
- Updated the documentation with detailed command examples and use cases, comprehensive context output documentation, troubleshooting section for common issues, and Cloud SIEM-specific configuration guide.
