## RunZero Integration Help

### Generate API tokens
To get started, you will need an API key / token or API client credentials.
Export API tokens and Organization API keys can be generated 
by going to the Organizations section in the runZero web console,
clicking on the appropriate organization name, and scrolling down to the export
tokens or API tokens section. 
A button there will let you generate a secure API key, in the form
of a long random token. You must have administrator access to generate API keys.

### API Limit
API calls are rate limited.
