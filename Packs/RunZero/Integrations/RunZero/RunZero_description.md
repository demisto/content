### Generate API tokens
To get started, you will need an API key / token or API client credentials.
If you have administrator access you can generate export API tokens and Organization API keys. 
1. In the RunZero web console, go to the Organizations section.
2. Click the appropriate organization name.
3. Scroll down to the export tokens or API tokens section. 
4. Click the button to generate a secure API key in the form of a long random token. 

### API Limit
API calls are rate limited.
