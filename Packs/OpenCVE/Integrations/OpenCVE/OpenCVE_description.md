# OpenCVE

OpenCVE is a platform used to locally import the list of CVEs and perform searches on it (by vendors, products, CVSS, CWE...).

Users subscribe to vendors or products, and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE.

You can [manually install](https://docs.opencve.io/installation/manual/) OpenCVE, or [use docker](https://docs.opencve.io/installation/docker/). They also provide a running instance at [https://www.opencve.io](https://www.opencve.io/) if you don't want to host it yourself.
