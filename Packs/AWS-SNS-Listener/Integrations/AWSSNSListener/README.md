Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers.
This integration was integrated and tested with version January 2024 of AWS-SNS-Listener.

## Configure AWS-SNS-Listener on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for AWS-SNS-Listener.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Long running instance |  Integration is long running by default| |
    | Listen Port | Runs the service on this port from within Cortex XSOAR. Requires a unique port for each long-running integration instance. Do not use the same port for multiple instances. Note: If you click the test button more than once, a failure may occur mistakenly indicating that the port is already in use. | False |
    | Username | Uses basic authentication for accessing the list. If empty, no authentication is enforced. \(For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM\) Optional for engines, otherwise mandatory. | False |
    | Password |  | False |
    | Endpoint | Set the endpoint of your listener. example: /snsv2 | False |
    | Certificate (Required for HTTPS) | \(For Cortex XSOAR 6.x\) For use with HTTPS - the certificate that the service should use. \(For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM\) Custom certificates are not supported. | False |
    | Private Key (Required for HTTPS) | \(For Cortex XSOAR 6.x\) For use with HTTPS - the private key that the service should use. \(For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM\) When using an engine, configure a private API key. Not supported on the Cortex XSOAR​​ or Cortex XSIAM server. | False |
    | Store sample events for mapping | Because this is a push-based integration, it cannot fetch sample events in the mapping wizard. After you finish mapping, it is recommended to turn off the sample events storage to reduce performance overhead. | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
