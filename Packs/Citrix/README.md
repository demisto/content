Citrix Cloud API Access with Service Principals
A service principal acts as an API client to Citrix Cloud APIs and has the following characteristics:

**1. Create a Service Principal**

In the Citrix Cloud console, click the menu in the upper left corner.

**2. Select Identity and Access Management > API Access > Service principals > Create service principal and follow the steps to completion.**

If these options do not appear, you might not have sufficient permissions to manage service principals. Contact your administrator to get the required full access permission.

1. Log in to the [Citrix Cloud](https://onboarding.cloud.com).
2. Select the Identity and Access Management option from the menu.
3. Click the API Access tab. You can see the customer ID in the description above the Create Client button.
