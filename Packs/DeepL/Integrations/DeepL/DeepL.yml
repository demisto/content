    description: Please note that with every submitted document of type .pptx, .docx or .pdf you are billed a minimum of 50'000 characters with the DeepL API plan, no matter how many characters are included in the document.  Because the request includes a file upload, it must be an HTTP POST request containing multipart/form-data. This call returns immediately after the document was uploaded and queued for translation. Further requests must be sent to the API to get updates on the translation progress or to download the translated document once the translation is finished (see other document request types below).  Once the document is fully uploaded, the translation starts immediately. Please be aware that the uploaded document is automatically removed from the server after the translation is done. You have to upload the document again in order to restart the translation.  The maximum upload limit for any document is 10MB and 1.000.000 characters.
