IT service management. Cortex XSOAR interfaces with ServiceNow to help streamline security-related service management and IT operations. For example, you can use the `ServiceNow` integration in order to:

- View, create, update or delete a ServiceNow ticket directly from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, and enrich it with Cortex XSOAR data.
- View, create, update and delete records from any ServiceNow table.
- Query ServiceNow data with the ServiceNow query syntax.
- Manage Security Incident Response (SIR) tickets with Cortex XSOAR, update tickets and enrich them with data.

Please refer to ServiceNow documentation for additional information. We especially recommend the [Operators available for filters and queries](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/sandiego-platform-user-interface/page/use/common-ui-elements/reference/r_OpAvailableFiltersQueries.html?cshalt=yes) page.

This integration was integrated and tested with the Orlando version of ServiceNow.

## Use cases
1. Get, update, create, and delete ServiceNow tickets, as well as add links and comments, or upload files to the tickets.
2. Fetch newly created incidents.
3. Get, update, create, delete records from any ServiceNow table.

## Required Permissions
To use ServiceNow on Cortex XSOAR, ensure your user account has the *rest_api_explorer* and *web_service_admin* roles.
 These roles are required to make API calls.
 Also add to your user account the specific tables that you want to have access to.
 However, these permissions may not suffice for managing records in some tables. Make sure you have the correct role so you have permissions to work with the relevant table.
 
## Wrapper Scripts
There are 3 scripts that serve as examples for wrapping the following generic commands:
servicenow-query-table - ServiceNowQueryIncident
servicenow-create-record - ServiceNowCreateIncident
servicenow-update-record - ServiceNowUpdateIncident

You can use these scripts if you want to wrap these commands around a ServiceNow table of your choice.
These scripts are wrapped around the incident table, so to wrap them around another table simply copy the scripts and edit the code, arguments and outputs accordingly.
## Configure ServiceNow v2 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for ServiceNow v2.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.
4. To ensure that mirroring works:
   1. Select the **Fetches incidents** radio button.
   2. Under **Classifier**, select ServiceNow Classifier.
   3. Under **Mapper (incoming)**, select ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper.
   4. Under **Mapper (outgoing)**, select ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper.
   5. To enable mirroring to close a ticket in Cortex XSOAR, under the **Mirrored XSOAR Ticket closure method** dropdown, select the ticket closing method,
      or set the *Mirrored XSOAR Ticket custom close state code* parameter, in order to override the default closure method with a custom state.
      In order to use *Mirrored XSOAR Ticket custom close state code* parameter, it must follow this format: "custom_state_code1=custom_label1,custom_state_code2=custom_label2,...",
      for example: “10=Design,11=Development,12=Testing”.
      Also, a matching user-defined list of customized incident close reasons must be configured as a "Server configuration" in Cortex XSOAR. (Meaning each Service Now custom state label will have a matching Cortex XSOAR custom close reason with the same name). ***Not following this format will result in a server error!***
      For more information about Customize Incident Close Reasons, see [this link](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Customize-Incident-Close-Reasons).

## Instance Creation Flow
This integration supports two types of authorization:
1. Basic authorization using username and password.
2. OAuth 2.0 authorization.

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization
To use OAuth 2.0 authorization follow the next steps:
1. Login to your ServiceNow instance and create an endpoint for XSOAR to access your instance (please see [Snow OAuth](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-platform-administration/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html) for more information). 
2. Copy the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` (press the lock next to the client secret to reveal it) that were automatically generated when creating the endpoint into the `Username` and `Password` fields of the instance configuration.
3. Select the `Use OAuth Login` checkbox and click the `Done` button.
4. Run the command `!servicenow-oauth-login` from the XSOAR CLI and fill in the username and password of the ServiceNow instance. This step generates an access token to the ServiceNow instance and is required only in the first time after configuring a new instance in the XSOAR platform.
5. (Optional) Test the created instance by running the `!servicenow-oauth-test` command.

**Notes:**
1. When running the `!servicenow-oauth-login` command, a refresh token is generated and will be used to produce new access tokens after the current access token has expired.
2. Every time the refresh token expires you will have to run the `servicenow-oauth-login` command again. Hence, we recommend setting the `Refresh Token Lifespan` field in the endpoint created in step 1 to a long period (can be set to several years). 
3. The grant type used to get an access token is `Client credentials`. See the [Snow documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-platform-security/page/administer/security/concept/c_OAuthApplications.html) for more information.


### Using Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA can be used both when using basic authorization and when using OAuth 2.0 authorization, however we strongly recommend using OAuth 2.0 when using MFA.
If MFA is enabled for your user, follow the next steps:
1. Open the Google Authenticator application on your mobile device and make note of the number. The number refreshes every 30 seconds.
2. Enter your username and password, and append the One Time Password (OTP) that you currently see on your mobile device to your password without any extra spaces. For example, if your password is `12345` and the current OTP code is `424 058`, enter `12345424058`.

**Notes:**
1. When using basic authorization, you will have to update your password with the current OTP every time the current code expires (30 seconds), hence we recommend using OAuth 2.0 authorization.
2. For using OAuth 2.0 see the above instructions. The OTP code should be appended to the password parameter in the `!servicenow-oauth-login` command.

4. Click **Done.**

## Fetch Incidents
The integration fetches newly created tickets according to the following parameters,
which you define in the instance configuration: ticket_type, query, and limit.
For the first fetch, the integration will fetch incidents that were created 10 minutes earlier. 
After that, the integration will fetch incidents created after the timestamp of the last fetch.

**look-back parameter note**:
In case the **look-back** parameter is initialized with a certain value and during a time that incidents were fetched, if changing 
the look back to a number that is greater than the previous value, then in the initial incident fetching there will be incidents duplications.
If the integration was already set with look back > 0, and the look-back is not being increased at any point of time, then those incident duplications would not occur.
Note that using a look-back value that is very large (more than an hour) can lead to an increase in the memory usage of the system in some cases, and it is highly unrecommended.
If there is a need to fetch incidents that require a long look-back to get fetched (for tracking issues, for example), use the mirroring feature and filter the results using the relevant tags instead of using the look-back feature. You can create a custom mapper and track the relevant fields. 

## Configure Incident Mirroring
**This feature is compliant with XSOAR version 6.0 and above.**  
When mirroring incidents, you can make changes in ServiceNow that will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR, or vice versa. 
You can also attach files from either of the systems which will then be available in the other system.  

The following instructions include steps for configuring the integration and incoming and outgoing mappers. However, they do not cover every option available in the integration nor classification and mapping features. 
For information about classification and mapping see [Classification and Mapping](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Classification-and-Mapping).  

**Note:**  
- For Cortex XSOAR version 6.1 only, the final source of truth for an incident are the values in Cortex XSOAR.  For example, if you change the severity in Cortex XSOAR and then change it back in ServiceNow, the final value that will be presented is the one in Cortex XSOAR. For versions 6.2 and later, if mirroring is in both directions then the latest update is the source of truth. 
- The mirroring settings apply only for incidents that are fetched after applying the settings. Pre-existing comments or work notes are not fetched/mirrored at the time of incident creation.
- To use a custom mapper, you must first duplicate the mapper and edit the field in the copy of the mapper. If you detach the out of the box mapper and make changes to it, the pack does not automatically get updates.

To set up incident mirroring you need to:  
1. Configure the ServiceNow Service Account roles.
2. Configure mirroring for ServiceNow trigger incidents or configure mirroring for other trigger incidents.

### Configure the ServiceNow Service Account Roles  
To use ServiceNow on Cortex XSOAR, ensure your service account has the following roles required to make API calls:  
- Rest_api_explorer
- Snc_platform_rest_api_access
- itil (optional)

**Note:**
If you choose to give permissions only for specific tables, you then need to add to your user account the specific tables you want to have access to. Make sure you have the correct role so you have permissions to work with the relevant table. Keep in mind that these permissions may not suffice for managing records in some tables.
- Read access to sys_journal_field (this is an elevated privilege) for accessing comments and work notes and for incoming mirroring. This is **not required** if you have `Use Display Value` enabled with `Instance Date Format` defined.  

 **Note:**  
   See this ServiceNow community link for [giving elevated read access](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=b4051bf4db4c1cd823f4a345ca9619dc) and potential risks.

  

### Configure Incident Mirroring When the Trigger Incident is ServiceNow  
When the trigger incident is ServiceNow, you use the **ServiceNow Classifier** and leave the Incident type as N/A, with either the default incoming and outgoing mappers or optional custom mappers.

#### STEP 1 - Configure the ServiceNow v2 Integration Instance for Mirroring.
1. Navigate to **Integrations** and search for **ServiceNow v2**.
2. Click **Add instance**.
3. Select **Fetches incidents**.
4. Under **Classifier**, select **ServiceNow Classifier**.  
    **Note:**  
    You define either the **Classifier** or the **Incident type** (not both). It is recommended to define the **Classifier** and leave **Incident type** N/A to enable labeling custom incident types under the ServiceNow Classifier.

5. Under **Mapper (incoming)**, for default mapping select ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper. For custom mapping, follow the instructions in STEP 2 and then select the custom mapper name.
6. Under **Mapper (outgoing)**, for default mapping select ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper. For
custom mapping, follow the instructions in STEP 3 and then select the custom mapper name.

7. Enter the connection parameters.  
    - Confirm whether your organization uses basic authorization or OAuth authorization (most use basic) and enter the relevant authorization details.  
    -  Leave **ServiceNow API Version** empty since ServiceNow typically automatically provides the appropriate version. 
8. Under **The query to use when fetching incidents**, the default query is to filter for new incidents: stateNOT IN6,7, where 6= resolved incidents and 7= closed incidents. For a different query, ask your ServiceNow representative to provide the exact states and their numbers.
9. Select **Get incident attachments** to retrieve attachments from ServiceNow incident creation in Cortex XSOAR.
10. Select the **Incident Mirroring Direction**:  
    - **In** - Mirrors changes on the ServiceNow ticket in to the Cortex XSOAR ticket.
    - **Out** - Mirrors changes on the Cortex XSOAR ticket to the ServiceNow ticket.
    - **Both** - Mirrors changes both in and out on both tickets.
11. Enable the checkbox for **Use Display Value** if you want to fetch comments and work notes without using sys_journal_field table which required an elevated read only permission.
12. If **Use Display Value** is enabled, **Instance Date Format** needs to be set to the date format that matches the date format used in ServiceNow by the user account used to configure the instance.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74367144/212351268-12938ccc-87d6-4f36-9c9b-ef7fcd3135a0.png)

13. Set the Timestamp field to query as part of the mirroring flow. This defines the ticket_last_update - the epoch timestamp when the ServiceNow incident was last updated. The default is sys_updated_on.
14. Enter the relevant **Comment Entry Tag**, **Work Note Entry Tag**, **File Entry Tag To ServiceNow** and **File Entry Tag From ServiceNow** values.  
These values are mapped to the **dbotMirrorTags** incident field in Cortex XSOAR, which defines how Cortex XSOAR handles comments when you tag them in the War Room.  
**Note:**  
These tags work only for mirroring comments, work notes, and files from Cortex XSOAR to ServiceNow.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/954dfad984230fde68dc45bd3dd50bde8338413a/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/mirror-tags.png)

15. Configure any **Custom Fields to Mirror**. These must start with "u_". This is available for ServiceNow v2 version 2.2.10 and later.  
  **Note:**  
  To enable mirroring custom fields, make a copy of the incoming and outgoing mappers and add the custom fields to the copies (see STEP 2 and STEP 3). Select these copies in the integration instance **Mapper (incoming)** and **Mapper (outgoing)** settings.
16. To enable mirroring when closing an incident or ticket in Cortex XSOAR and ServiceNow, select the *closed* option from the **Mirrored XSOAR Ticket closure method** dropdown and **Mirrored ServiceNow Ticket closure method** respectively.
17. Click **Done**.

#### STEP 2 (Optional) Configure the Incoming Mapper by Incident Type for Custom Fields  
**Note:**
Any modifications require that the mappers be cloned before any changes can be applied.

1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping** and for **Incidents** search for the **ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper**.
2. Select it and click **Duplicate**.
3. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select ServiceNow Create Ticket and Mirror.
4. Verify the mapper has these fields mapped. They will pull the values configured on the integration instance settings at the time of ingestion.
  
     ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/ad6522b9c6822f5c4f9798c8aaa1a63c353ddbe3/docs/doc_imgs/snowv2-incoming-mapper.png) 

    - **dbotMirrorId** - dbotMirrorId - the field used by the third-party integration to identify the ticket. This should be the sys_id of the ServiceNow ticket. The value is mapped to incident.servicenowticketid.
    - **dbotMirrorDirection** - determines whether mirroring is incoming, outgoing, or both. Default is Both. This should match the instance configuration.        
    - **dbotMirrorInstance** - determines the ServiceNow instance with which to mirror. This should match the instance configuration.
    - **dbotMirrorLastSync** - determines the field by which to indicate the last time that the systems synchronized.
    - **dbotMirrorTags** - determines the tags that you need to add in Cortex XSOAR for entries to be pushed to ServiceNow. They should be copied from the tags in the instance configuration. These are also the tags that must be put on the War Room record in order for it to sync.
      - To mirror files, use the **ForServiceNow** tag. 
      - To mirror general notes, use the **comments** tag.
      - To mirror private notes that can be read only by users with the necessary permissions, use the **work_notes** tag.
    - Configure any custom fields you want mapped to Cortex XSOAR. Custom fields start with “u_” and are available for ServiceNow v2 version 2.2.10 and later. These must be added to the integration instance **Custom Fields to Mirror** setting.

#### STEP 3 - Modify the Outgoing Mapper  
**Note:**  
Any modifications require that the mappers be cloned before any changes can be applied.
1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping**, and for **Incidents** search for the **ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper.**
2. Select it and click **Duplicate**.  
  The left side of the screen shows the ServiceNow fields to which to map and the right side of the
screen shows the Cortex XSOAR fields by which you are mapping.
3. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select the relevant incident type (for example **ServiceNow Ticket**).
4. Under **Schema Type**, select **incident**. The Schema Type represents the ServiceNow entity that
you are mapping to. In our example it is an incident, but it can also be any other kind of ticket that
ServiceNow supports.
5. On the right side of the screen, under **Incident**, select the incident based on which you want to
match.
6. Change the mapping according to your needs, including any fields you want mapped outward to ServiceNow and any custom fields. Make sure the custom fields you want mirrored are added to the integration instance settings.
7. Save your changes.

#### STEP 4 - Create an Incident in ServiceNow  
For purposes of this use case, it can be a simple incident. The new ticket will be ingested in Cortex XSOAR in approximately one minute.

#### STEP 5 - Add a Note to the Incident in Cortex XSOAR    
In the example below, we have written *A comment from Cortex XSOAR to ServiceNow*.
1. Click Actions > Tags and add the comments tag.
2. Add a file to the incident and mark it with the ForServiceNow tag.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/d9bd0725e4bce1d68b949e66dcdd8f42931b1a88/Packs/ServiceNow/Integrations/ServiceNowv2/doc_files/mirror-files.png)  

3. Navigate back to the incident in ServiceNow and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there, too.  
  You can make additional changes like closing the incident or changing severity and those will be reflected in both systems.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/d9bd0725e4bce1d68b949e66dcdd8f42931b1a88/Packs/ServiceNow/Integrations/ServiceNowv2/doc_files/ticket-example.png)


### Configure Incident Mirroring When the Trigger Incident is **Not** ServiceNow  

You can set up any source integration to create a ServiceNow ticket based on a fetched incident and mirror the ticket in Cortex XSOAR. To do this you need to:    
- Configure the ServiceNow v2 integration to map the appropriate fields from the **ServiceNow Create Ticket and Mirror** incident type to the relevant trigger incident type (for example, Phishing Custom).
- Set up the source integration to create a ServiceNow ticket and start mirroring.

#### STEP 1 - Configure the ServiceNow v2 Integration Instance for Mirroring.
1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping**. For **Incidents**, search for **ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper** and **ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper**.
2. For each mapper, click **Duplicate**.  
   Your copied mappers will be called **ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper_copy** and **ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper_copy**, you can rename them. The copied mappers appear in the drop down for the **Mapper (incoming)** and **Mapper (outgoing)** integration instance settings fields.
3. Navigate to **Integrations** and search for **ServiceNow v2**.
4. Click **Add instance**.
5. Select **Do not Fetch**.
6. Under **Classifier**, select ServiceNow Classifier.  
    **Note:**  
    You define either the **Classifier** or the **Incident type** (not both). It is recommended to define the **Classifier** and leave **Incident type** N/A to enable labeling custom incident types under the ServiceNow Classifier.

7. Under **Mapper (incoming)**, select **ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper_copy** (or whatever you renamed it).
8. Under **Mapper (outgoing)**, select **ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper_copy** (or whatever you renamed it). 
9. Enter the connection parameters.  
    - Confirm whether your organization uses basic authorization or OAuth authorization (most use basic) and enter the relevant authorization details.  
    -  Leave **ServiceNow API Version** empty since ServiceNow typically automatically provides the appropriate version. 
10. Under **The query to use when fetching incidents**, the default query is to filter for new incidents: stateNOT IN6,7, where 6= resolved incidents and 7= closed incidents. For a different query, ask your ServiceNow representative to provide the exact states and their numbers.
11. Select **Get incident attachments** to retrieve attachments from ServiceNow incident creation in Cortex XSOAR.
12. Select the **Incident Mirroring Direction**:  
    - **In** - Mirrors changes on the ServiceNow ticket in to the Cortex XSOAR ticket.
    - **Out** - Mirrors changes on the Cortex XSOAR ticket to the ServiceNow ticket.
    - **Both** - Mirrors changes both in and out on both tickets.
13. Enable the checkbox for **Use Display Value** if you want to fetch comments and work notes without using sys_journal_field table which required an elevated read only permission.
14. If **Use Display Value** is enabled, **Instance Date Format** needs to be set to the date format that matches the date format used in ServiceNow by the user account used to configure the instance.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74367144/212352242-329284d8-6936-4f6c-9a30-c741b7425ff8.png)

15. Set the **Timestamp field to query as part of the mirroring flow**. This defines the ticket_last_update - the epoch timestamp when the ServiceNow incident was last updated. The default is sys_updated_on.
16. Enter the relevant **Comment Entry Tag**, **Work Note Entry Tag**, **File Entry Tag To ServiceNow** and **File Entry Tag From ServiceNow** values.
These values are mapped to the **dbotMirrorTags** incident field in Cortex XSOAR, which defines how Cortex XSOAR handles comments when you tag them in the War Room.  
**Note:**  
These tags work only for mirroring comments from Cortex XSOAR to ServiceNow.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/954dfad984230fde68dc45bd3dd50bde8338413a/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/mirror-tags.png)

17. Configure any **Custom Fields to Mirror**. These must start with "u_". This is available for ServiceNow v2 version 2.2.10 and later.  
  **Note:**  
  To enable mirroring custom fields, make a copy of the incoming and outgoing mappers and add the custom fields to the copies (see STEP 2 and STEP 3). Select these copies in the integration instance **Mapper (incoming)** and **Mapper (outgoing)** settings.
18. To enable mirroring when closing an incident or ticket in Cortex XSOAR and ServiceNow, select the *closed* option from the **Mirrored XSOAR Ticket closure method** dropdown and **Mirrored ServiceNow Ticket closure method** respectively.
19. Click **Done**.

#### STEP 2 (Optional) Configure the Incoming Mapper by Incident Type for Custom Fields  
**Note:**
Any modifications require that the mappers be cloned before any changes can be applied.

1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping** and for **Incidents** search for the **ServiceNow - Incoming Mapper_copy** (or whatever you renamed it).
2. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select the relevant triggering incident type, for example Phishing.
3. Verify the mapper has these fields mapped. They will pull the values configured on the integration instance settings at the time of ingestion.

    - **dbotMirrorId** - dbotMirrorId - the field used by the third-party integration to identify the ticket. This should be the sys_id of the ServiceNow ticket. The value is mapped to incident.servicenowticketid.
    - **dbotMirrorDirection** - determines whether mirroring is incoming, outgoing, or both. Default is Both. This should match the instance configuration.        
    - **dbotMirrorInstance** - determines the ServiceNow instance with which to mirror. This should match the instance configuration.
    - **dbotMirrorLastSync** - determines the field by which to indicate the last time that the systems synchronized.
    - **dbotMirrorTags** - determines the tags that you need to add in Cortex XSOAR for entries to be pushed to ServiceNow. They should be copied from the tags in the instance configuration. These are also the tags that must be put on the War Room record in order for it to sync.
      - To mirror files from XSOAR to ServiceNow, use the **ForServiceNow** tag. 
      - Mirrored files from ServiceNow to XSOAR will be tagged by *default* with the **FromServiceNow** tag.
      - To mirror general notes, use the **comments** tag.
      - To mirror private notes that can be read only by users with the necessary permissions, use the **work_notes** tag.
    - Configure any custom fields you want mapped to Cortex XSOAR. Custom fields start with “u_” and are available for ServiceNow v2 version 2.2.10 and later. These must be added to the integration instance **Custom Fields to Mirror** setting.  
4. Save your changes.

#### STEP 3 - Modify the Outgoing Mapper for Custom Fields  
**Note:**  
Any modifications require that the mappers be cloned before any changes can be applied.
1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping**, and for **Incidents** search for the **ServiceNow - Outgoing Mapper_copy** (or whatever you renamed it).
2. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select the relevant incident type (for example **ServiceNow Ticket**).
3. Under **Schema Type**, select **incident**. The Schema Type represents the ServiceNow entity that
you are mapping to. In our example it is an incident, but it can also be any other kind of ticket that
ServiceNow supports.
4. On the right side of the screen, under **Incident**, select the incident based on which you want to
match.  
   The left side of the screen shows the ServiceNow fields to which to map and the right side of the screen shows the Cortex XSOAR fields by which you are mapping.
5. Change the mapping according to your needs, including any fields you want mapped outward to ServiceNow and any custom fields. Make sure the custom fields you want mirrored are added to the integration instance settings.
6. Save your changes.

#### STEP 4 - Set up Your Source Integration  
Set up your source integration so that after fetching a trigger incident a ServiceNow ticket is created and mirroring starts.  
1. Fetch an incident with your chosen integration. For example, for Phishing using any email integration (Gmail, MSGraph, O365).
2. Classify and map the incident fields.
3. Create a task in the playbook that creates a ServiceNow ticket followed by a set incident task that starts the mirroring capability.  

Example:
The following shows the Create New Record playbook task, which creates a ServiceNow ticket.  

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/20d4fb13f3d1c822f3f3be479cc281c45dbc5667/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/snowv2-create-new-record.png)

The Create New Record task is followed by the Set Mirroring Fields task, which starts the mirroring capability.  

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content-docs/996d0dbad4430d325e030d7a75251d8d38ca7778/docs/doc_imgs/integrations/snowv2-set-mirroring-fields.png)

The new ServiceNow ticket will be ingested in Cortex XSOAR in approximately one minute.

#### STEP 5 - Add a Note to the Incident in Cortex XSOAR  
In the example below, we have written *A comment from Cortex XSOAR to ServiceNow*.
1. Click Actions > Tags and add the comments tag.
2. Add a file to the incident and mark it with the ForServiceNow tag.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/d9bd0725e4bce1d68b949e66dcdd8f42931b1a88/Packs/ServiceNow/Integrations/ServiceNowv2/doc_files/mirror-files.png)  

3. Navigate back to the incident in ServiceNow and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there, too.  
  You can make additional changes like closing the incident or changing severity and those will be reflected in both systems.

| Mirroring is not working. | Open Context Data and search for dbot. Confirm the dbot fields are configured correctly either through the mapper for that specific incident type or using setIncident. Specifically, make sure the integration instance is configured correctly for the mirroring direction (ingoing, outgoing, both) - dbotMirrorId, dbotMirrorDirection, dbotMirrorInstance, dbotMirrorTags                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   
| Comments and work notes from before incident creation are not fetched/mirrored. | Mirroring settings apply only for incidents that are fetched after applying the settings. <br></br> For example, if a user creates a ServiceNow incident with added comments/work notes and then defines a ServiceNow integration instance with mirroring in Cortex XSOAR, those comments/work notes are not fetched with the incident in Cortex XSOAR. <br></br> To fetch pre-existing comments/work notes, you can use the ***servicenow-get-ticket-notes*** command.  <br></br> To retrieve comments and work notes using this command follow one of these steps: <br></br> - Grant elevated privileges to the **sys_journal_field**. This is done by assigning the **Itil** role (see this ServiceNow community link on [giving elevated read access](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=b4051bf4db4c1cd823f4a345ca9619dc) and potential risks). <br></br> - Select the `Use Display Value` checkbox in the instance configuration. This will retrieve comments and work notes using their display value from ServiceNow. When choosing this option, you must select the date format of your instance from the `Instance Date Format` dropdown menu (see the [ServiceNow documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-platform-administration/page/administer/time/task/t_PersonalizeTheSystemDateFormat.html) for an explanation how to find the date format of your instance). Note that in this case, the values that will appear under the `sys_created_by` field of the retrieved notes are the display values from ServiceNow and not the system values, e.g., "System Administrator" instead of "admin". |  
| Ticket is not closing. | Verify the integration instance is configured correctly for the *Mirrored XSOAR Ticket closure method* or *Mirrored ServiceNow Ticket closure method* fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

To resolve this:  <br></br> - Turn off Auto-Extract for all fields and only used on specific fields.  <br></br> - Turn off Auto-Extract at the incident level and use the task level for extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
