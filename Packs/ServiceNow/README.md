Cortex XSOAR interfaces with ServiceNow to help streamline security-related service management and IT operations. 

The data in ServiceNow tickets can be mirrored to Cortex XSOAR so that you can track the status and information in the task. 
You can also provide comments or attachments in XSOAR which will appear in ServiceNow. 


# What does this pack do?

- View, create, update, or delete a ServiceNow ticket directly from the Cortex XSOAR and enrich it with Cortex XSOAR data.
- View, create, update, and delete records from any ServiceNow table.
- Query ServiceNow data with the ServiceNow query syntax.

As part of this pack, you will also get 2 out-of-the-box layouts so that you can visualize ServiceNow ticket information in Cortex XSOAR.


The Create ServiceNow Ticket playbook provides an example for how to use the Mirror ServiceNow Ticket playbook to mirror data and ServiceNow Ticket State Polling sub-playbook to track when the ticket closes.
