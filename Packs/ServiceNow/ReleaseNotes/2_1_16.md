#### Integrations
##### ServiceNow v2
Added support for the ***get-modified-remote-data*** command which returns a list of modified incidents since the last update.
The incoming mirror command, ***get-remote-data***, will run only on the modified incidents identified by this command.
For more information, see [our documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/mirroring_integration).
