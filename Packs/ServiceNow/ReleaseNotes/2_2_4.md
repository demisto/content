#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow v2

- When creating notes in XSOAR, the integration displays the username of the user that created the note. However, when an
  automation creates a note, it shows up as "dbot". Now, this will also happen for instances where the user field is populated with
  an empty string.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.9.6.22912*.
