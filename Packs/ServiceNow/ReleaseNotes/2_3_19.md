#### Integrations
##### ServiceNow v2
- Added the **close_ticket_multiple_options** integration param to replace **close_ticket** integration param. If the instance is already configured with ***close_incident*** leave this field as None. Otherwise, change this field to 'closed' or 'resolved' to determine the ticket closing method.
