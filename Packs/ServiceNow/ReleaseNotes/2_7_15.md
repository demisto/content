#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow v2

- Updated the ServiceNow v2 integration to support the MirrorObject fields in the *servicenow-create-ticket* command.
- Added support for **get-remote-data-preview** command that gets remote data preview from a remote incident. This method does not update the current incident, and is used to preview the ticket which would be updated.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.8.3296088*.
