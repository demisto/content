#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow v2

- Added dedicated credential fields for **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Username**, and **Password** (replacing the **Username/Client ID** and **Password/Client Secret** credential fields). Re-enter your credentials in the new fields when upgrading to ensure full functionality. Existing instances remain functional with the legacy credential fields if the new fields are left empty. 
- Added support for automatic OAuth 2.0 login and refresh token renewal by providing **Username** and **Password** in the instance configuration. If the fields are left empty, you must manually run `!servicenow-oauth-login` to obtain the initial refresh token each time it expires.
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new credential field structure and automated refresh token renewal.
