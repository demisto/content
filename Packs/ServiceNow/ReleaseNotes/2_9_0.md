#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow v2

- Added dedicated credential fields for **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Username**, and **Password** (replacing the **Username/Client ID** and **Password/Client Secret** credential fields). Re-enter your credentials in the new fields when upgrading to ensure full functionality. Existing instances remain functional with the legacy credential fields if the new fields are left empty. 
- When using OAuth 2.0, providing the `Username` and `Password` in the instance configuration now enables automatic first-time login — the integration will automatically perform the initial OAuth login and obtain a refresh token without requiring a manual `!servicenow-oauth-login` command. It will also automatically renew the refresh token when it expires. Without these fields, you must manually run `!servicenow-oauth-login` to obtain the initial refresh token and each time it expires.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new credential field structure and automated refresh token renewal.

##### ServiceNow CMDB

- Split the combined `Username/Client ID` and `Password/Client Secret` credential fields into separate dedicated fields: `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Username`, and `Password`. Existing instances will continue to work — if the new `Username` and `Password` fields are left empty, the integration falls back to the legacy credential fields. However, it is highly recommended to re-enter your credentials in the new dedicated fields when upgrading.
- When using OAuth 2.0, providing the `Username` and `Password` in the instance configuration now enables automatic first-time login — the integration will automatically perform the initial OAuth login and obtain a refresh token without requiring a manual `!servicenow-cmdb-oauth-login` command. It will also automatically renew the refresh token when it expires. Without these fields, you must manually run `!servicenow-cmdb-oauth-login` to obtain the initial refresh token and each time it expires.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new credential field structure and automated refresh token renewal.
