#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow v2

- Split the combined `Username/Client ID` and `Password/Client Secret` credential fields into separate dedicated fields: `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Username`, and `Password`. Existing instances will continue to work — if the new `Username` and `Password` fields are left empty, the integration falls back to the legacy credential fields. However, it is highly recommended to re-enter your credentials in the new dedicated fields when upgrading.
- When using OAuth 2.0, providing the `Username` and `Password` in the instance configuration is now required for the integration to automatically renew the refresh token when it expires. Without these fields, you must manually run `!servicenow-oauth-login` each time the refresh token expires.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new credential field structure and automated refresh token renewal.
