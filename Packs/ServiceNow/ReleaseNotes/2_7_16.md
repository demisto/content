#### Integrations

##### ServiceNow Event Collector
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.8.3296088*.

- Added support for the **service-now-oauth-login** command that resets the integration and clears the stored oauth refresh token so it can generate a new one. Use this command if you have trouble connecting due to access_denied or other errors.
