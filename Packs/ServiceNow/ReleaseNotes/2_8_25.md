## ServiceNow Integration Improvements

### Improved Error Handling and Compatibility
- Enhanced error handling in the `send_request` function with specific exception handling for different request errors (timeout, connection errors, etc.)
- Added detailed docstrings to improve code readability and maintainability
- Improved proxy handling with better error management and environment variable checks
- Updated the `unicode_to_str_recur` function to be more robust and compatible with different Python environments

These changes make the integration more resilient to network issues and provide clearer error messages for troubleshooting.
