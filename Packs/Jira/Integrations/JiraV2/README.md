Use the Atlassian Jira v2 integration to manage Jira issues and create Cortex XSOAR incidents from Jira projects.

This integration was integrated and tested with version 1001.0.0-SNAPSHOT of Jira.
For more information about JQL syntax, go to https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql.

## Use Cases
---
1. Create, edit, delete, and query Jira issues.
2. Get or add to the comments of an issue.
3. Add a link or upload an attachment to an issue.

## Configure jira-v2 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for jira-v2.
3. **Authentiction**: As of June 2019, basic authentication using passwords for Jira is no longer supported. Use an API token or OAuth 1.0 instead.
4. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.
    *  ______________ Basic Authentication ________________
    
        To use basic authentication, follow [this tutorial](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html) to get the API token. Authorizing the use of basic authentication requires:
    
        * __Username__
        * __Password (Deprecated)__
        * __API token__
        
    * ____________________ OAuth 1.0 __________________
           
      To use OAuth1.0 follow [this tutorial](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/) to get the Access token. Authorizing the use of OAuth1.0 requires:

        * __ConsumerKey__
        * __AccessToken__
        * __PrivateKey__

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Jira URL, for example: https://demisto.atlassian.net/ |  | True |
    | Username (Basic Authentication) |  | False |
    | Password (Deprecated - Use API token) |  | False |
    | API token |  | False |
    | Consumer key (OAuth 1.0) |  | False |
    | Access token |  | False |
    | Private key (PKCS8 format) |  | False |
    | Query (in JQL) for fetching incidents |  | False |
    | Issue index to start fetching incidents from |  | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Mirror incoming incidents |  | False |
    | Incident type |  | False |
    | Use created field to fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Mirror outgoing incidents |  | False |
    | File entry tag | Choose the tag to add to an entry to mirror it as an attachment in Jira. | False |
    | Comment entry tag | Choose the tag to add to an entry to mirror it as a comment in Jira. | False |
    | Fetch comments | Fetch comments for Jira ticket. | False |
    | Fetch attachments | Fetch attachments for Jira ticket. | False |

5. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Fetched Incidents Data
---
When you enable incidents fetching, Cortex XSOAR fetches the first batch of Jira issues from the 10 minutes prior to when the integration was added. After the first batch of fetched issues, Cortex XSOAR fetches new Jira issues as soon as they are generated in Jira. By default, 50 issues are fetched for each call. To fetch older Jira issues, use the query to fetch issues option.
If `Fetch comments` is enabled, The fetched incident will include the comments in the Jira issue.
If `Fetch attachments` is enabled, The fetched incident will include the attachments in the Jira issue.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

## Configure Incident Mirroring
**This feature is compliant with Cortex XSOAR version 6.0 and above.**
This part walks you through setting up the Jira integration to mirror incidents from Jira in Cortex XSOAR. 
The instructions below include steps for configuring the integration and the incoming and outgoing mappers. However, not every option available in the integration, nor all classification and mapping features are covered. 
For information about **Classification and Mapping** visit: [Classification and Mapping](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-0/cortex-xsoar-admin/incidents/classification-and-mapping.html).

When mirroring incidents, you can make changes in Jira, which will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR, or vice versa. 
You can also attach files from either of the systems, which will then be available in the other system. 

This is made possible by the addition of 3 new functions to the integration, which are applied with the following options:
- External schema support
- Can sync mirror in
- Can sync mirror out

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/d9bd0725e4bce1d68b949e66dcdd8f42931b1a88/Packs/ServiceNow/Integrations/ServiceNowv2/doc_files/mirror-configuration.png)

#### STEP 1 - Modify the incoming mapper.
1. Navigate to **Classification and Mapping** and click **classifier-mapper-incoming-JiraV2**.
2. Under the Incident Type dropdown, select **Jira Incident**.
3. Change the mapping according to your needs.
4. Save your changes.
    
##### 5 fields have been added to support the mirroring feature:
- **dbotMirrorDirection** - determines whether mirroring is incoming, outgoing, or both. Default is Both.
    - You can choose the mirror direction when configuring the Jira instance using the **Incident Mirroring Direction** field.

- **dbotMirrorId** - determines the incident ID in the 3rd party integration. In this case, the Jira ID field.
- **dbotMirrorInstance** - determines the Jira instance with which to mirror.
- **dbotMirrorLastSync** - determines the field by which to indicate the last time that the systems synchronized.
- **dbotMirrorTags** - determines the tags that you need to add in Cortex XSOAR for entries to be pushed to Jira.
    - You can set the tags in the instance configuration, using **File Entry Tag**, and **Comment Entry Tag**.

#### STEP 2 - Modify the outgoing mapper.
1. Under **Classification and Mapping**, click **classifier-mapper-outgoing-Jira**.
2. Under **Select Instance** dropdown, select the instance name you want to work with.
The left side of the screen shows the Jira fields to map and the right side of the
screen shows the Cortex XSOAR fields by which you are mapping.
  *Note: If **Select Instance** dropdown is empty, go to the integration's settings and under **Incident Type** select **Jira Incident** and try again.
3. Under **Schema Type**, select **Jira Incident**. The Schema Type represents the Jira entity that
you are mapping to. In our example it is an incident, but it can also be any other kind of ticket that
Jira supports.

4. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select **Jira Incident**.
5. On the right side of the screen, under **Incident**, select the incident based on which you want to
match.
6. Change the mapping according to your needs.
7. Save your changes.

#### STEP 3 - Configure the following integration fields in order to customize the mirroring feature:
1. **Mirror outgoing incidents**: If enabled, any incident data changed in existing fetched incidents will be reflected in the remote Jira server.
2. **Mirror incoming incidents**: If enabled, any incident data changed in the remote Jira server will be reflected in existing fetched incidents.
3. **Fetch incident**s: Should be enabled in order to mirror in and out new incidents.
4. **Incident type**: In order to mirror out changes, provide an incident type that is associated with a layout containing the fields, which values you want to mirror. You can use 'Jira Incident', which already has a built-in layout. 
5. **File Entry Tag**: Choose a tag to add to an entry in order to mirror it as an attachment in Jira.
6. **Comment Entry Tag**: Choose a tag to add to an entry in order to mirror it as a comment in Jira.
7. **Fetch Comments**: Fetch comments for Jira ticket.
8. **Fetch Attachments**: Fetch attachments for Jira ticket.

#### STEP 4 - Create an incident in Jira. For the purpose of this use case, it can be a very simple incident.

#### STEP 5 - In Cortex XSOAR, the new ticket will be ingested in approximately one minute.
1. Add a note to the incident. In the example below, we have written a comment from Cortex XSOAR to Jira.
2. Click Actions -> Tags and add the **Comment Entry Tag** tag that you've selected before. If not already modified, the default is: "comment".
3. Add a file to the incident and mark it with the **File Entry Tag** tag that you've selected before. If not already modified, the default is: "attachment".

5. Go back to **Incident Info** and locate a field you've configured in the outgoing mapper that is displayed in the incident's layout. Change its value and click 'V' in the 'V/X' menu to save the changes.
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/6ec8b4443de51ff1c9bf593526226df2b5b4f2ba/Packs/Jira/doc_files/edit_incident_via_layout.png)
6. Navigate back to the incident in Jira and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there as well.
7. Change a Jira field you've configured in the incoming mapper.
8. Go back to Cortex XSOAR and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there as well.
* You can make additional changes like closing the incident or changing the description and those will be reflected in both systems.


**Notes**
- The final 'source of truth' of the incident for Cortex XSOAR are the values in Cortex XSOAR. 
  Meaning, if you change the severity in Cortex XSOAR and then change it back in Jira, the final value that will be presented is the one in Cortex XSOAR.
  You can see a list of these fields for each incident under "Context Data" -> "dbotDirtyFields".
- If you wish to mirror in and out Jira's custom fields, please see the 'Mirror In And Out Custom Fields' section below.
- If you wish to change the status of a Jira incident using transitions, please see the 'Change Ticket's Status Using Transitions' section below.


## Mirror In And Out Custom Fields:

### Add a new custom field and add it to the incident type&#39;s layout:

Add a new custom field and add it to the incident type&#39;s layout:

1.Create a new incident field:
  1. Go to settings -> advanced -> fields -> new field
  2. Under "Basic Settings":
    a.provide a name
    b.Choose field type. For example for a label, you might want to use "Tag" as a type.
  3. Click on "Attributes":  
  a.Uncheck the box under: "Add to incident types"  
  b.for “Add associated type...” Select the incident type you want to work with. In this example I’ll choose “Jira Incident”.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/906a19790e33e8c36a6de6cf141b6f88453ae551/Packs/Jira/doc_files/upload_json_11.png)

## Change Ticket's Status Using Transitions
1. Make sure you've configured your instance as described in **'Configure Incident Mirroring'** above.
2. Make sure you're using the 'Jira Incident Layout' for displaying the incident which status you want to change.
 The reason this is required is that this layout is structured in a way that both **'script-JiraChangeTransition'** and **'script-JiraListTransition'** scripts can work, which is crucial when you want to use transitions.
3. In order to change an incident status, open the incident you would like to update.
4. Under **"Incident Info"** search for the "Jira Transitions" field.
5. Click on "Select" and choose the name of the new status.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/6ec8b4443de51ff1c9bf593526226df2b5b4f2ba/Packs/Jira/doc_files/list_transitions.png)
6. Click on the 'V' option in the 'V/X' menu.
7. You can see the new status under 'Jira Status'.
8. Go to Jira, within approximately one minute you will be able to see the new status there as well.
