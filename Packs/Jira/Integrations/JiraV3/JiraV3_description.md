Please configure only one of the following fields:

1. Cloud ID - Used for Jira Cloud instance.
2. OnPrem - Leave the Cloud ID empty, and fill in the rest of the fields.

##### Cloud ID

1. Go to your [Admin page](https://admin.atlassian.com/.
2. Click the **Products** tab on the top banner and choose the appropriate site under **Sites and Products** on the left side bar. Your Cloud ID will appear in the URL:
`https://admin.atlassian.com/s/{cloud_id}/users`

#### Authentication Methods
There are 2 authentication methods:
- **Basic Authentication**
- **OAuth 2.0**

### Basic Authentication
Leave the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields empty and fill in the following fields:
- *User name* - Enter your user email.
- *API key* - Enter the API token. To generate API token, see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

##### Basic Authentication permissions
Ensure that you possess the necessary permissions by navigating to **Project Settings** > **Permissions** in the project.
Locate permissions for the tasks listed below:
* Browse projects
* Create issues
* Edit issues
* Delete issues
* Transition issues
* Create attachments
* Add comments
* Link issues
### OAuth 2.0
For both instances (Cloud ID & OnPrem), it is advised to use the `https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/authcode` **Callback URL**. The OProxy URL is a client side only web page that provides an easy interface to copy the obtained auth code from the authorization response to the integration configuration in the authorization flow steps. Optionally, if you don't want to use the OProxy URL, you can use a localhost URL on a port which is not used locally on your machine. For example: <http://localhost:9004>. You will then need to copy the code from the URL address bar in the response.

#### Cloud authentication

Go to your [Developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/) page, and choose the App you want to integrate with your instance. It must be of type OAuth 2.0. For creating a new app with type OAuth 2.0, click **Create** and choose **OAuth 2.0 integration** and follow the steps.

##### Callback URL

1. Go to the **Authorization** tab, and click **Add** on the authorization with type of OAuth 2.0 (3LO).
2. Insert a **Callback URL**.

##### Client ID, Client Secret

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** to the Client ID and Client Secret fields, respectively.

##### Cloud Scopes

The integration uses the *offline_access* scope, in order to retrieve refresh tokens.
