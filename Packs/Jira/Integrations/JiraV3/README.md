Use the Jira integration to manage issues and create Cortex XSOAR incidents from Jira projects. From Cortex XSOAR version 6.0 and above, the integration also mirrors issues to existing issue incidents in Cortex XSOAR. The integration now supports both OnPrem, and Cloud instances.
This integration was integrated and tested with: Jira Cloud Platform V3 (for Cloud), Jira Software Cloud (for Cloud), Jira Server Platform 9.6.0 (for OnPrem), Jira Software Server 9.6.0 (for OnPrem).

Some changes have been made that might affect your existing content.
If you are upgrading from a previous version of this integration, see [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes-from-the-previous-version-of-this-integration-atlassian-jira-v3).

## Configure Atlassian Jira V3 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Atlassian Jira V3.
3. **Authentication**: Basic Authentication and OAuth 2.0 are used for both Jira Cloud, and OnPrem. Read the [Authentication](#authentication) process in order to configure your instance
4. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |

    | Issue index to start fetching incidents from | This parameter is dismissed if "id" is not chosen in "Issue Field to Fetch by". This will only fetch Jira issues that are part of the same project as the issue that is configured in this parameter. If this value is 0, then the fetch mechanism will automatically start the fetch from the smallest ID with respect to the fetch query. | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Incident type |  | False |
    | Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident | When selected, marking the Jira issue as resolved will be mirrored in Cortex XSOAR, and will close the corresponding incident. Please make sure the \`Resolved\` field in your Jira instance is configured in order for this to work properly, if not, it will rely on if the status of the issue is changed to \`Done\`. | False |
    | Mirroring Direction |  | False |

    | Fetch attachments | Fetch attachments for a Jira ticket. | False |
    | Max incidents per fetch | The maximum allowed value is dictated by the Jira property 'jira.search.views.default.max'. If you specify a value that is higher than this number, your search results will be truncated. Default value is 50. | False |
    | Time range for initial data fetch | The time range to consider for the initial data fetch in format: &lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;. This parameter is only relevant when selecting to fetch by created time, or updated time. Default is 3 days. For example: 2 minutes, 2 hours, 2 days, 2 months, 2 years | False |

5. Check [Authorization Flow In Cortex XSOAR](#authorization-flow-in-cortex-xsoar) in order to authenticate and test the connection.


Configure only one of the following fields:

- Cloud ID - Used for Jira Cloud instance.
- OnPrem - Leave the Cloud ID empty, and fill in the rest of the fields.

##### Cloud ID

1. Go to your [Admin page](https://admin.atlassian.com/).
2. Click the **Products** tab on the top banner and choose the appropriate site under **Sites and Products** on the left side bar. Your Cloud ID will appear in the URL:
`https://admin.atlassian.com/s/{cloud_id}/users`

## Authentication
### Basic Authentication
Leave the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields empty and fill in the following fields:
- *User name* -Enter your user email.
- *API key* - Enter the API token. To generate API token, see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)

##### Basic Authentication permissions
Ensure that you possess the necessary permissions by navigating to **Project Settings** > **Permissions** in the project.
Locate permissions for the tasks listed below:
* Browse projects
* Create issues
* Edit issues
* Delete issues
* Transition issues
* Create attachments
* Add comments
* Link issues



### OAuth 2.0
For both instances (Cloud ID & OnPrem), it is advised to use the `https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/authcode` **Callback URL**. The OProxy URL is a client side only web page which provides an easy interface to copy the obtained auth code from the authorization response to the integration configuration in the authorization flow steps. Optionally, if you don't want to use the OProxy URL, you can use a localhost URL on a port that is not used locally on your machine. For example: <http://localhost:9004>. You will then need to copy the code from the URL address bar in the response (see [Authorization Flow In Cortex XSOAR](#authorization-flow-in-cortex-xsoar)).

#### Cloud authentication

Go to your [Developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/) page, and choose the App you want to integrate with your instance. It must be of type OAuth 2.0. For creating a new app with type OAuth 2.0, click **Create** and choose **OAuth 2.0 integration** and follow the steps.

##### Callback URL

1. Go to the **Authorization** tab, and click **Add** on the authorization with type of OAuth 2.0 (3LO).
2. Insert a **Callback URL**.

##### Client ID, Client Secret

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** to the Client ID and Client Secret fields, respectively.

##### Cloud Scopes

The integration uses the *offline_access* scope, in order to retrieve refresh tokens.

###### Classic Scopes

* read:jira-work
* read:jira-user
* write:jira-work

##### Granular Scopes

* read:jql:jira
* read:issue-details:jira
* write:board-scope:jira-software
* read:board-scope:jira-software
* read:sprint:jira-software
* read:epic:jira-software
* write:sprint:jira-software

#### OnPrem authentication

1. Log in to Jira as a user with `Jira Administrator` permissions.
2. Click the Jira Administration tab (the gear icon found in the top right corner) and click **Applications**.
3. To create a new `Application link`, which will be used to integrate Cortex XSOAR with Jira:
    a. Click **Application links** under `Integrations`, found on the left side menu.
    b. Click **Create link** and choose **External application** with the **Incoming** direction.
4. Fill in the required details as explained in the page and choose the permission **Write**.
5. Once the link is created, you will be able to see `Client ID`, and the `Client secret`, which are required in the configuration screen. Copy these values and paste them into the respective fields in the configuration screen.

#### OnPrem Scopes

Write

##### Authorization Flow In Cortex XSOAR

1. Create the authentication application as explained in the [Authentication](#authentication) section.
2. Run the command `!jira-oauth-start`, where you will be presented with a URL to authenticate yourself.
3. After authenticating, you will be redirected to the configured callback URL, where you will retrieve the authorization code provided as a query parameter called `code`.
4. Insert the retrieved authorization code as an argument to the `!jira-oauth-complete` command.
5. Run the `!jira-oauth-test` to test the connection of the instance.

## Fetch Incidents

When you enable incidents fetching, you have the option to configure a query which will be used to fetch Jira issues as incidents in Cortex XSOAR. The query uses one of the following fields in order to progressively fetch incidents:

* `id` of Jira issues
* `created time` of Jira issues
* `updated time` of Jira issues (using this field may cause duplicates, so be wary)

If `created time`, or `updated time` is selected when fetching incidents for the first time, then the `Time range for initial data fetch` argument is used in the fetch query.
By default, 50 issues are fetched for each call.
If `Fetch comments` is enabled, The fetched incidents will include the comments in the Jira issue, and preview them in the form of a table in the incident info tab.
If `Fetch attachments` is enabled, The fetched incidents will include the attachments in the Jira issue.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

**Notes**:

1. For OnPrem, all the commands use the **WRITE** scope, for Cloud, the required scopes for each command will be mentioned under the name of the command.
2. For the commands that are shared between Jira V2 and V3, we still support the arguments from V2, but are configured to be hidden, and are prioritized when supplied to the commands, to not break backwards compatibility.

## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Atlassian Jira V3 corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:

1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in Atlassian Jira V3 events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in Atlassian Jira V3 events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and Atlassian Jira V3 events will be reflected in both directions. |

3. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding event is closed in Atlassian Jira V3.

When mirroring incidents, you can make changes in Jira, which will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR, or vice versa.
You can also attach files from either of the systems, which will then be available in the other system.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
In order for the mirroring to work properly, please keep the timezone of the Jira profile public.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Atlassian Jira V3.

### 9 Incident Fields have been added/updated to enhance the mirroring experience

* **dbotMirrorTags** - Determines the tags that you need to add in Cortex XSOAR for entries to be pushed to Jira, and entries coming from Jira (Attachments or comments entries)
  * You can set the tags for incoming entries in the instance configuration, using **Attachment Entry Tag from Jira**, and **Comment Entry Tag from Jira**.
  * You can set the tags for outgoing entries in the instance configuration, using **Attachment Entry Tag to Jira**, and **Comment Entry Tag to Jira**.
* **Jira Issue Type** - Shows the type of the Jira issue.
* **JiraV3 Status** - Shows the status of the Jira issue. You can press on it in the **JiraV3 Incident Layout** to see the available statuses that you can transition into, and press on one of them to change the status of the issue. ![Show Jira statuses](doc_files/jira-status.png)
* **Jira Estimate** - Shows the estimate of the Jira issue. The field can also be edited and mirrored out. Use the format 2w 4d 6h 45m (w - weeks, d - days, h - hours, m - minutes). Please add the `Time Tracking` field to the screen in your Jira projects in order for this field to work properly.
* **Jira Component** - Shows the components of the Jira issue. The field can also be edited and mirrored out.
* **Source Created By** - Shows the display name, and email of the user who created the Jira issue.
* **Jira Subtask** - Shows the subtasks of the Jira issue in the form of a table.
* **Jira Project** - Shows the project name where the Jira issue resides in.
* **Last Update Time** - Shows the last updated time of the Jira issue.
* **Jira Comment** - Shows the comments of the Jira issue in the form of a table.

#### Modify the incoming mapper

1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Objects Setup** -> **Classification and Mapping** and click **classifier-mapper-incoming-JiraV3**.
2. Under the Incident Type dropdown, select **JiraV3 Incident**.
3. Change the mapping according to your needs.
4. Save your changes.

#### Modify the outgoing mapper

1. Under **Classification and Mapping**, click **classifier-mapper-outgoing-Jira**.
2. Under **Select Instance** dropdown, select the instance name you want to work with.
The left side of the screen shows the Jira fields to map and the right side of the
screen shows the Cortex XSOAR fields by which you are mapping.
  *Note: If **Select Instance** dropdown is empty, go to the integration's settings and under **Incident Type** select **JiraV3 Incident** and try again.
3. Under **Schema Type**, select **JiraV3 Incident**. The Schema Type represents the Jira entity that
you are mapping to. In our example it is an incident, but it can also be any other kind of ticket that
Jira supports.
![Outgoing editor](doc_files/outgoing-editor.png)
4. Under the **Incident Type** dropdown, select **JiraV3 Incident**.
5. On the right side of the screen, under **Incident**, select the incident based on which you want to
match.
6. Change the mapping according to your needs.
7. Save your changes.

#### Configure the following integration parameters in order to customize the mirroring feature

1. **Mirror Direction**:
    * **Mirror outgoing incidents**: If enabled, any incident data changed in existing fetched incidents will be reflected in the remote Jira server.
    * **Mirror incoming incidents**: If enabled, any incident data changed in the remote Jira server will be reflected in existing fetched incidents.
2. **Fetch incidents**: Should be enabled in order to mirror in, and out new incidents.
3. **Incident type**: In order to mirror out changes, and mirror in incoming changes, provide an incident type that is associated with a layout containing the fields you want to mirror. You can use 'JiraV3 Incident', which already has a built-in layout, and functionality fit for the `JiraV3 Incident` type.
4. **Attachment Entry Tag from Jira**: Choose a tag to add to an attachment entry when mirroring in an attachment from Jira.
5. **Attachment Entry Tag to Jira**: Choose a tag to add to an entry in order to mirror it as an attachment in Jira.
6. **Comment Entry Tag from Jira**: Choose a tag to add to a note entry when mirroring in comments from Jira.
7. **Comment Entry Tag to Jira**: Choose a tag to add to an entry in order to mirror it as a comment in Jira.
8. **Fetch Comments**: Fetch comments for Jira ticket.
9. **Fetch Attachments**: Fetch attachments for Jira ticket.
10. **Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident**: Marking the Jira issue as resolved will be mirrored in Cortex XSOAR, and will close the corresponding incident. Please make sure the `Resolved` field in your Jira instance is configured in order for this to work properly, if not, it will rely on if the status of the issue is changed to `Done`.

#### Simple Mirroring flow

1. Create an incident in Jira. For the purpose of this use case, it can be a very simple incident. In Cortex XSOAR, the new ticket will be ingested in approximately one minute
2. Add a note to the incident, which can be done using the `Add Comment` section in the `JiraV3 Incident Layout`. In the example below, we have written a comment from Cortex XSOAR to Jira.
![Add comment button](doc_files/add-comment-button.png)
3. Add the **Comment Entry Tag to Jira** tag that you've configured in the instance before. The default is: "comment tag".
4. Add a file to the incident's War Room.
5. Click Actions -> Tags and add the **Attachment Entry Tag to Jira** tag that you've configured in the instance before. The default is: "attachment tag".  
![Add attachment with tag](doc_files/add-attachment-with-tag.png)
6. Go back to **Incident Info** and locate a field you've configured, or was already configured in the outgoing mapper that is displayed in the incident's layout. Change its value and click 'V' in the 'V/X' menu to save the changes.
![Changed value in layout](doc_files/changed-value-in-layout.png)
7. Navigate back to the issue in Jira, and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there as well.
8. Change a Jira field you've configured in the incoming mapper.
9. Go back to Cortex XSOAR and within approximately one minute, the changes will be reflected there as well.

#### Simple Comment and Attachment Mirroring flow

##### Mirror out Comment

1. Press on the `Press to add comment to Jira issue` button in the `Add Comment` section.
2. Add a comment and the tag that was configured in the **Comment Entry Tag to Jira** parameter.
3. Once the comment is mirrored out to Jira, it will include the sentence **Mirrored from Cortex XSOAR**, to differentiate between comments mirrored from XSOAR, and normal comments.
![Mirrored out comment](doc_files/mirrored-out-comment.png)

##### Mirror in Comment

1. Add a comment inside the Jira issue.
2. The newly added comment will be mirrored in to XSOAR as a note, with the addition of the sentence **Jira Author: {Author name}**, to know the author of the comment, and tagged with the tag configured in **Comment Entry Tag from Jira** parameter.
![Mirrored in comment](doc_files/mirrored-in-comment.png)

##### Mirror out Attachment

1. Add an attachment to the incident, and add the tag that was configured in the **Attachment Entry Tag to Jira** parameter.
2. Once the attachment is reflected in Jira, the name of the file will have **_mirrored_from_xsoar** in it, to differentiate between attachments mirrored from XSOAR, and normal attachments.

![Mirror out attachment](doc_files/mirror-out-attachment.png)

##### Mirror in Attachment

1. Once an attachment is mirrored in from Jira into XSOAR, the attachment will be tagged with the tag configured in **Attahcment Entry Tag from Jira** parameter.
![Mirror in attachment](doc_files/mirror-in-attachment.png)

**Notes**

* The final `source of truth` of the incident for Cortex XSOAR are the values in Cortex XSOAR.
  Meaning, if you change the severity in Cortex XSOAR and then change it back in Jira, the final value that will be presented is the one in Cortex XSOAR.
  You can see a list of these fields for each incident under "Context Data" -> "dbotDirtyFields".
* If you wish to mirror in and out Jira's custom fields, please see the [Mirror In And Out Custom Fields](#mirror-in-and-out-custom-fields) section below.
* If you wish to change the status of a JiraV3 Incident using the available transitions, please see the [Change Ticket's Status Using Transitions](#change-tickets-status-using-transitions) section below.
* If you wish to change the status of a JiraV3 Incident using the available statuses, please see the [Change Ticket's Status](#change-tickets-status) section below.

## Mirror In And Out Custom Fields

### Add a new custom field and add it to the incident type&#39;s layout

Add a new custom field and add it to the incident type&#39;s layout:

1.Create a new incident field:

  1. Go to Settings -> Object Setup -> Incident Fields -> New Field
  2. Choose a field type. For example, for a label, you might want to use "Tag" as a type.
  3. Add a short description in the `Tooltip` box (not mandatory).
  4. Click on `Attributes`:  
    - Uncheck `Add to incident types` checkbox.
    - For `Add to associated type`, select the incident type you want to work with, preferably choose `JiraV3 Incident`.
![New incident field](doc_files/new-incident-field.png)

2.Add the new incident field you&#39;ve just created to the layout associated with the integration&#39;s incident type. In this example, the layout is "JiraV3 Incident Layout":
![Layout](doc_files/layouts.png)

### Add the new field to the incoming mapper

1. Configure the `Atlassian Jira V3` integration, and test the connection of the instance as explained in the [Authentication](#authentication).
2. Make sure that:
    * Under "Incident type" you&#39;ve selected the incident type you want to work with and it is the same one you&#39;ve selected once you created the new field. In our example: `JiraV3 Incident`.
    * The option `Fetch Incidents` is checked.
    * You have filled the respective parameters for the fetch to work, as explained in [Fetch Incidents](#fetch-incidents)
    * The `Mirror Direction` is set to **Incoming And Outgoing**.
    Finally, click `Done`, and wait for new JiraV3 Incidents to be pulled:

3. Once you&#39;ve finished the setup stage, go to the `Mapper (incoming)` field and select the mapper you want to work with by clicking on **Select**:

4. Click on the button next to the `Mapper (incoming)` field in order to edit the selected mapper. It will open the `Incident Incoming Mapping Editor`.
    1.For "Incident Type", please provide the incident type you&#39;ve selected in the integration settings.  
    2.In "Select Instance" choose the name of your instance. You can find it in the integration settings under `Name`.
    Once done, You&#39;ll see on the right side of the screen a JiraV3 Incident.  
    * Note: If you want to work with a specific incident, in `Get data` select the option: `Upload JSON` and provide the wanted incident as JSON.  
    In order to get the incident as JSON, you can see the section: [How to get an incident as JSON](#how-to-get-an-incident-as-json) below.  
    On the left side, You&#39;ll see all JiraV3 Incident fields.
    3.Use "Search Cortex XSOAR field…" in order to find your new incident field by searching its name.  
    4.Once found, click on "Choose data path" and map it to the custom jira field:
        a.Find the jira field you want to map to this incident field on the right side, and click on its value.
        b.Then you will see the path you&#39;ve selected under your new added field:
        ![New incident field mapping in](doc_files/new-incident-field-mapping-in.png)
        *Note: In this example: **customfield_10097** is the Jira field ID we want to map. You can find IDs of custom fields for your field in Jira using this guide:[Click Here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-find-id-for-custom-field-s-744522503.html)
        *Note: You can also type the path manually.
5. Click "Save Version".

### Add the new field to the outgoing mapper

1. Got to the configured `Atlassian Jira V3` instance's settings.
2. Go to the `Mapper (outgoing)` field and select the mapper you want to work with by clicking on "Select" (the same process we did with the incoming mapper).
3.
4. Click on the button next to the `Mapper (outgoing)` field in order to edit the selected mapper. It will open the "Incident Outgoing Mapping Editor".
5. In "Select Instance" choose the name of your instance. You can find it in the integration settings under `Name`.
6. Select one incident to work with by specifying it in the `Incident` list.  
    1.On the right side you are now able to see your selected incident.  
    2.On the left side you are able to see all the Jira fields you can map in the system.
7. Search for the Jira field you want to map on the left side. In this example, we want to map **customfield_10097**
![New incident field mapping out](doc_files/new-incident-field-mapping-out.png)
8. Map the Jira field to the incident field you&#39;ve created by clicking on `Select incident field` and type its name.  
*The name of the incident will not include spaces, underscores, capital letters, etc. for example: Jira Transitions will be transformed to "jiratransitions" once saved in the incident&#39;s context (you can see the name you need to select by fetching incidents after configuring the mapper in. In the "Incident" field select one of the new incidents that the edited mapper in has worked on. On the right side you should be able to see the new added field and the name you need to provide).
9. Click the "Save Version" button.

#### How to get an incident as JSON

1. Use the !jira-get-issue command with the raw-response=true parameter. For example: ```!jira-get-issue issue_id=VIK-183 raw-response=true```
2. Click on `view full JSON in a new tab`.
3. Click on `Download as a file`.
4. Open the downloaded file and put its content inside a list, resulting in a list which contains only one item, the downloaded JSON.
5. When selecting `Upload JSON` for `Get data` as mentioned above, you can upload the file using the `Upload JSON` option.

## Change Ticket's Status Using Transitions or Statuses

1. Make sure you're using the 'JiraV3 Incident Layout' for displaying the incident which status you want to change.
 The reason this is required is that this layout is structured in a way that the **script-JiraChangeTransition**, **script-JiraListTransition**, **JiraListStatus**, and **JiraChangeStatus** scripts can work, which is crucial when you want to change the status of the issue.
2. In order to change an incident status, open the incident you would like to update.
3. Under **Incident Info** search for the `Jira Transitions`, or `Jira Status` field.
4. Click on "Select" and choose the name of the transition or status to apply.
![Jira transition](doc_files/jira-transition.png)
![Jira status](doc_files/jira-status.png)
5. Click on the 'V' option in the 'V/X' menu.
6. You can see the new status under 'Jira Status'.
7. Go to Jira, and you will be able to see the new status there as well.
