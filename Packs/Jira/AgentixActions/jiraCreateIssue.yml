description: > 
  Creates a new issue in a Jira project (Cloud or Server).
  You can use this command to open incidents, tasks, or sub-tasks directly in Jira as part of an automated workflow or manual response.
  It supports both basic field-based input (like summary, project, and issue type) and advanced use through a full issue_json object for maximum flexibility.
  The command allows setting properties such as assignee, reporter, priority, due date, environment, components, and labels.
  Compatible with Jira Cloud and Jira Server. Fields and behavior may vary slightly between platforms.
args:
  - name: issue_json
    description: >
      Not recommended to use.
      A complete issue object in JSON format. This is intended for advanced users. When using this argument,
      all other arguments are ignored, and the entire issue must be defined in JSON — including required fields
      like `summary`, `project.key`, and `issuetype.id` or `issuetype.name`.
      Note: Only the project key is supported (not the project name).  
      Example: 
      {
        "fields": {
          "summary": "New issue summary",
          "project": {"key": "DEMO"},
          "issuetype": {"name": "Task"}
        }
      }
