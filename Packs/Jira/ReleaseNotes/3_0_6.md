#### Integrations

##### Atlassian Jira v3

- Fixed an issue where the integration returned an error when fetching by ID, and the issue index to start fetching incidents from is not found in the Jira instance.
- Added the argument **query** to the command ***jira-get-id-offset***, which enables the user to get the ID offset with respect to the given query.
