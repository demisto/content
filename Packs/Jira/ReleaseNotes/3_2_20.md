#### Integrations

##### Atlassian Jira v3

Updated the *Jira V3* integration to fix a timezone-related issue that caused the fetching of duplicate incidents. To maintain backwards compatibility, this fix only applies to newly configured integration instances or to existing integration instances after the "last run" timestamp is manually reset.
