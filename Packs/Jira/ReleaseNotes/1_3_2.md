##### Atlassian Jira v2
- **Breaking Change**: Reverted a change that was introduced in version *1.2.1* as it was not compatible with Jira Server. The *reporter* argument to the ***jira-create-issue*** command was changed back to refer to the name of the reporter. Use the new argument *reporter_id* for specifying the reporter's Account ID.
- Added the *reporter_id* argument to the ***jira-create-issue*** command, which enables to set an issue reporter using the user's Account ID in order to support changes in the Jira Cloud API.
