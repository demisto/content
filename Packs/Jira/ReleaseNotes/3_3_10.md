#### Integrations

##### Atlassian Jira v3

- Updated the Jira V3 integration to use the scope *read:project:jira* as part of the OAuth authentication flow.
- Fixed an issue where *jira-board-list* command would fail in OAuth authentication flow due to missing scope. In order to apply the new scope please rerun the authentication commands. **jira-oauth-start**, **jira-oauth-complete.**
