comment: "Preprocessing script for email communication layout.\nThis script checks if the incoming email contains an Incident ID to link the mail to an existing incident, and tags the email as \"email-thread\".\nThis script runs with elevated permissions. \nCortex XSOAR recommends using the built-in RBAC functionality to limit access to only those users requiring access to this script.\nFor more information about the preprocessing rules, refer to: https://demisto.developers.paloaltonetworks.com/docs/incidents/incident-pre-processing"
