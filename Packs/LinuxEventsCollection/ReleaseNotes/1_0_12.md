#### Parsing Rules

##### Linux Events Collection Parsing Rule

- Improved implementation of the existing parsing rule. 
- Added support for additional ISO 8601 profiles, that uses a space delimiter only between the date and time components, such as `2024-11-07 10:23:15.654+0000` and `2024-11-07 10:23:15.654+03:00`.
