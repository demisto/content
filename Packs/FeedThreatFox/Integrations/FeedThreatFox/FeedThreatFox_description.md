## ThreatFox Feed Integration Help

ThreatFox is a free platform from abuse.ch with the goal of sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malware with the infosec community, AV vendors and threat intelligence providers.

The ThreatFox Feed allows users to fetch indicators from ThreatFox.

A manual command is also available to retrieve indicators from ThreatFox as needed.
For more details, refer to the ThreatFox documentation: <https://threatfox.abuse.ch/api/>
