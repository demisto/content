## ThreatFox Feed Integration Help

ThreatFox is a free platform from abuse.ch with the goal of sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malware with the infosec community, AV vendors and threat intelligence providers.

The ThreatFox Feed allows users to fetch indicators from ThreatFox.

Note, the fetch interval must be a whole number of days: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
Please note that the fetch indicators process will automatically skip any indicators of type SHA3, and these will not be retrieved or processed by the integration.

A manual command is also available to retrieve indicators from ThreatFox as needed and should be used with caution.
For more details, refer to the ThreatFox documentation: <https://threatfox.abuse.ch/api/>
