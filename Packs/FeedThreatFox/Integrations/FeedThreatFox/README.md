ThreatFox is a platform from abuse.ch and Spamhaus dedicated to sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with malware, with the infosec community, AV vendors and cyber threat intelligence providers.

#### Create an Auth Key for abuse.ch
>
> Note: If you already have a profile, you can skip steps 1 and 2.

1. Sign up for an abuse.ch account. You can do this easily by using an existing account that you may already have on X, LinkedIn, Google or Github. Just log in with the authentication provider of your choice here: https://auth.abuse.ch/
  
2. Once you are authenticated on abuse.ch, ensure that you connect at least one additional authentication provider. This will ensure that you have access to abuse.ch platforms, even if one of the authentication providers you use shuts down (yes, it happened with Twitter!)

3. Ensure that you hit the "Save profile" button. In the "Optional" section, you can now generate an "Auth-Key". This is your personal Auth-Key that you can now use in the integration.
