    "description": "The Spamhaus DROP (Don't Route Or Peer) lists are advisory \"drop all traffic\" lists, consisting of netblocks that are \"hijacked\" or leased by professional spam or cyber-crime operations (used for dissemination of malware, trojan downloaders, botnet controllers). The DROP lists are a tiny subset of the SBL, designed for use by firewalls and routing equipment to filter out the malicious traffic from these netblocks.",
