To use the CrowdStrike OpenAPI integration, you need the ID and secret of an API client that has right scopes granted to it.

For more details, refer to the [CrowdStrike OAuth2-Based APIs documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/46/crowdstrike-oauth2-based-apis).

This integration was auto generated from the CrowdStrike Falcon OpenAPI specification and is not fully tested.

Note: This is a beta Integration, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the integration is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the integration during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the integration to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.
