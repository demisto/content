  additionalinfo: "Runs the service on this port from within Cortex XSOAR. Requires a unique port for each long-running integration instance. Do not use the same port for multiple instances. Note: If you click the test button more than once, a failure may occur mistakenly indicating that the port is already in use. (For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM) If you do not enter a Listen Port, an unused port for Ping Castle will automatically be generated when the instance is saved. However, if using an engine, you must enter a Listen Port."
