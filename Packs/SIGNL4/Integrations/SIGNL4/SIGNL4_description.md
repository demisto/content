In order to configure the SIGNL4 pack in Cortex XSOAR you just need the SIGNL4 team or integration secret. You can find the same in your SIGNL4 web portal under Teams or under Integrations -> Installed -> Inbound Webhook. It is the last part of your webhook URL.

You find more information about SIGNL4 at [signl4.com](https://signl4.com).
