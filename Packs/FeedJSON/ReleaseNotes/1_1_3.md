#### Integrations
##### JSON Feed
- **Breaking Change**: The integration now validates that both configuration params: *Indicator Type* and *Auto detect indicator type* are not set. You may set only one of the configuration params at a time. Previously, if both were set, *Auto detect indicator type* was used and *Indicator Type* was silently ignored.
- Added the *Include indicator type for mapping* configuration option. When using a custom classifier and mapper with this feed, use this option to include the indicator type in the raw json used for classification and mapping.
