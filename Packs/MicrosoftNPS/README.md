## Collect Events from Vendor

In order to use the collector, you can use one of the following options to collect events from the vendor:
 - [XDRC (XDR Collector)](#xdrc-xdr-collector) 

In either option, you will need to configure the vendor and product for this specific collector.

### XDRC (XDR Collector)
You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/cortex-xdr-collectors/xdr-collector-datasets#id7f0fcd4d-b019-4959-a43a-40b03db8a8b2).\
You can configure the vendor and product by replacing [vendor]_[product]_raw with msft_nps_raw.\
When configuring the instance, you should use a yml that configures the vendor and product, like this example for the Microsoft NPS product:

```
filebeat.inputs:
- type: filestream
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - c:\windows\system32\logfiles\*.log
  processors:
    - add_fields:
        fields:
          vendor: msft
          product: nps
```
