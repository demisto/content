#### Integrations

##### LogPoint SIEM Integration

- Added the timeout parameter to the **lp-get-searchid** command, which enables you to define the amount of time that the integration will try to execute commands before it throws an error.
- Updated the **lp-search-logs** command to retrieve all the search logs, instead of only a portion.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.99865*.
