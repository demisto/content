#### Correlation Rules
##### New: Gitlab - User Permission Changed
Added a new correlation rule for User Permission Changed.

#### Playbooks
##### New: Gitlab - Guest user permission change
- Added a new playbook which investigates a "User Permission Changed” alert by gathering user and IP information and performs remediation based on the information gathered and received from the user. To link this playbook to the relevant alerts automatically, we recommend using the following filters when configuring the playbook triggers: Alert Source = Correlation AND Alert Name = Gitlab - Permission change from guest to owner.

Used Sub-playbooks:
* Enrichment for Verdict
* Block IP - Generic v3
* Block Account - Generic v2
