#### Integrations
##### mnemonic MDR - Argus Managed Defence (Partner Contribution)
- Rapidly detect, analyse and respond to security threats with mnemonicâ€™s leading Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
- - Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/argus-toolbelt:2.0.0.16706*.
- Support for Incident Mirroring
  - Implements the methods:
    - `get-remote-data`
    - `update-remote-system`
    - `get-mapping-fields`
  - Mirror up and down Argus Case comments, attachments, priority and status.
  - The default playbook is required to fetch all attachments and comments that are added to the Argus Case prior to incident being fetched in XSOAR. 
  Please keep that in mind if defining your own playbooks. 
- Added 3 commands
  - ***argus-print-case-comments*** 
  prints Argus Case comments as War Room Notes instead of adding them to context data
  - ***argus-print-case-metadata-by-id***
  prints Argus Case metadata as a War Room chat instead of adding the json to the context data
  - ***argus-download-case-attachments*** is a simple way to download all Argus Case attachments with one dedicated integration command instead of having to use a playbook to list all attachments and download all one by one.
- Added 3 integration parameters
  - *exclude_tag* allows the integration to exclude fetching incidents from Argus Cases with the specified tag of key or key: value pair.
  - *mirroring_direction* defines the directions the integration will mirror incidents: None, In, Out, Both.
  - *mirror_tag* defines the tag that has to be attached to War Room entries (notes or attachments) which will be mirrored out.
