mnemonic helps businesses manage their security risks, protect their data and defend against cyber threats. Our expert team of security consultants, product specialists, threat researchers, incident responders and ethical hackers, combined with our Argus security platform ensures we stay ahead of advanced cyberattacks and protect our customers from evolving threats.
Taking advantage of big data analytics, machine learning, and a complex event-processing framework, Argus provides the advanced threat prevention ecosystem needed to see the big threat picture in real-time and protect our customers against advanced persistent threats, zero days and targeted attacks.
As part of our leading Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services, Argus is tightly incorporated with our customers' processes, frameworks and workflows, and will serve as an integral component in the detection and response workflows we establish together with our customers’ CSIRTs.

# What does this content pack do?
The playbook included in this Pack offers a streamlined integration between the mnemonic’s Argus Managed Defence MDR service and Palo Alto Networks XSOAR. 
This integration enables automated enrichment into XSOAR by pulling metadata, attachments, comments, tags and events related to Argus cases for later use.
