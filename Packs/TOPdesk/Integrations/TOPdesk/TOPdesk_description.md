## TOPdesk
This integration supports SupportingFilesAPI version `1.38.0` and higher. See the integration documentation for additional information on version support and more.

*Person* and *operator* are TOPdesk's user types. Each user type has a different set of actions that he is allowed to perform.
For example, a *person* can only update incidents he created, while an *operator* can update a wider range of incidents.

In general, if an account is able to perform the requested command in TOPdesk's UI, it should be able to perform it using this integration.
Make sure you use the right account for your needs and that the account used has all the required permissions. 
For more details on permissions specific to commands visit the TOPdesk integration documentation.

### Setup TOPdesk's application password
1. Login to TOPdesk with the designated account.
2. In TOPdesk, click **Open user menu** (top right side of the front page) > Choose **My settings**
3. At the bottom of the page should be an **Application passwords** section. You can view all application passwords that are configured for the logged in account.

5. A window should open requesting a name for the application. Choose any convenient name (e.g., XSOAR-key) and click **Create**.

7. Once copied for further usage you can click **Close**.

### Configure Username and Password
