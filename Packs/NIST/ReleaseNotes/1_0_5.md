- **What information was needed sooner?**
- **Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?**
- **How could information sharing with other organizations have been improved?**
- **What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents?**
- **What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?**
- **How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate?**
