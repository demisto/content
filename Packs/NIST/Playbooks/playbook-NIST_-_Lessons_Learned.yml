      description: "One of the most important parts of incident response is also the
        most often omitted: learning and improving. Each incident response team should
        evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and lessons learned. \nThis
        provides a chance to achieve closure with respect to an incident by reviewing
        what occurred, what was done to intervene, and how well intervention worked.
