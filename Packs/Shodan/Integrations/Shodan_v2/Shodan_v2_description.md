# Shodan v2

Shodan is a search engine for Internet-connected devices. Unlike traditional search engines that index websites, Shodan indexes information about the devices connected to the internet, such as servers, routers, webcams, and other IoT devices.


## Setup

To enable the Shodan integration you need to have an API key, which you can get for free by creating a Shodan account <https://account.shodan.io/register>
Once you have an API key you insert it into the *API Key* field and click the **Test** button.

 
## Rate Limits

All API plans are subject to a rate limit of 1 request per second - [docs](https://account.shodan.io/billing)
