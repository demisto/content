Single Connect is a PAM product that enables enterprises to remove static passwords stored in applications by instead keeping passwords in a secure password vault. Single Connect provides a token-based authentication for 3rd party applications when accessing the password vault. This authentication process verifies the application identity and gives secure access to the password associated with that identity.
