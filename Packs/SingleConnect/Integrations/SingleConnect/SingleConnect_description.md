## About Single Connect

Single Connect Password Vault enables enterprises to remove static passwords stored in applications and keep passwords in a secure password vault.

Single Connect provides token-based authentication for 3rd party applications when accessing password vault. This process verifies the application's identity and gives secure access to the password associated with that identity.
