The Microsoft Management Activity API integration enables you to subscribe or unsubscribe to different audits, receive their content, and fetch new content as incidents. Through the integration you can subscribe to new content types or stop your subscription, list the available content of each content type, and most importantly, fetch new content records from content types of your choice as Cortex XSOAR incidents.

This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of Microsoft Management Activity API (O365 Azure Events).

## Grant Cortex XSOAR Authorization in Microsoft Management Activity API

## Additional Information
- Record types to fetch from should be set with numerical values from the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#auditlogrecordtype). For example, in order to fetch events of type **MailSubmission**, the value **29** should be set.
- Note that the API only supports start times up to 7 days in the past when fetching. If the last fetch timestamp exceeds this limit, the integration automatically fetches data from 7 days ago.
