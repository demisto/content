#### Integrations
##### Microsoft Management Activity API (O365 Azure Events)
- Added the `timeout` parameter that sets the default timeout value for the various commands. The timeout can be overridden by providing a value for `timeout` argument when calling a command. 
- Fixed an issue where ***ms-management-activity-list-content*** command would fail parsing the timeout argument.
