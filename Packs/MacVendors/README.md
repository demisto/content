## MAC Vendors

### What is this pack?
This pack accesses the API available at [MAC Vendors](https://macvendors.com/api). It provides the ability to query a MAC address and have the vendor name returned in response.

### Do I need an API key?
You do not need an API key, however, without one you will be limited to 1,000 requests per day (at 1 request per second).
If you need to purchase an API key, you can do so [here](https://macvendors.com/plans)

### Accepted MAC address formats
Send your MAC address in any shape or form and the API should be able to handle it. Separated by periods? Dashes? Slashes? Separated every 2 characters? 4 characters? Not a problem. Generally, MAC addresses will come in the following shape or form:

- 00-11-22-33-44-55
- 00:11:22:33:44:55
- 00.11.22.33.44.55
- 001122334455
- 0011.2233.4455
