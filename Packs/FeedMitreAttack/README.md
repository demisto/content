We recommend using the MITRE v2 Feed instead. The MITRE v2 Feed is more aligned with the STIX format, and includes more objects, such as Malware, Intrusion Set and Relationships.

Use the MITRE ATT&CK Feed pack to fetch indicators from MITRE ATT&CK. MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations of cyber security threats.

You can 
- Retrieve indicators from MITRE ATT&CK.
- Look up the reputation of the indicators.
- Perform a generic search across the MITRE ATT&CK indicators.
- Display the feed names and IDs from TAXII.

Note: When you fetch indicators from MITRE ATT&CK, indicators are not created within Cortex XSOAR.
