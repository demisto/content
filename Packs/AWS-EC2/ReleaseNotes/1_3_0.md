#### Integrations

##### AWS - EC2

- You can now configure the integration with a list of AWS accounts (as the parameter `AWS organization accounts`) and a role name which grants full access to each of them (as the parameter `Role name for cross-organization account access`). This will allow the command `aws-ec2-describe-addresses` to run in all of the accounts specified.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/boto3py3:1.0.0.84358*.

**NOTE**: This version will break backwards compatibility in scripts that use the output of an ***AWS - EC2*** integration command. The ***AWSRecreateSG*** script will work from version *1.1.11*.
