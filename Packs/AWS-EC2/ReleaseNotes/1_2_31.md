#### Integrations
##### AWS - EC2
- Added the *IpPermissionsFull* argument to the following commands so that we can more easily remove/copy security group rules: *aws-ec2-authorize-security-group-ingress-rule*, *aws-ec2-authorize-security-group-egress-rule*, *aws-ec2-revoke-security-group-ingress-rule*, and *aws-ec2-revoke-security-group-egress-rule*.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/boto3py3:1.0.0.49886*.
