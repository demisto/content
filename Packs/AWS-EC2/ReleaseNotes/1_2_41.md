#### Integrations

##### AWS - EC2

You can now configure the integration with a list of AWS accounts (as the parameter `AWS organization accounts`) and a role name which grants full access to each of them (as the parameter `Role name for cross-organization account access`). This will allow the command `aws-ec2-describe-addresses` to run in all of the accounts specified.
