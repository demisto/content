# Okta ASA

Okta Advanced Server Access provides Zero Trust identity and access management for cloud and on-premises infrastructure.
Using Okta as its source of truth, Advanced Server Access reconciles accounts to manage SSH and RDP access to Linux and Windows servers.

Advanced Server Access extends secure privileged access to users, automates lifecycle management for server accounts, and eliminates the need for credential management.
