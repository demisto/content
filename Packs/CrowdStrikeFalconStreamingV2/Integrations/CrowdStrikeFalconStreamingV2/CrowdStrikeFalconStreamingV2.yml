- additionalinfo: As this is a push-based streaming integration, it cannot fetch sample events in the mapping wizard. To view sample events, you need to enable events storage and run the crowdstrike-falcon-streaming-get-sample-events command. After you finish mapping, it is recommended to turn off the sample events storage to reduce performance overhead.
