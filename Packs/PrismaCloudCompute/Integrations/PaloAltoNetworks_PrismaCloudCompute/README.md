Prismaâ„¢ Cloud Compute Edition delivers cloud workload protection (CWPP) for modern
enterprises, providing holistic protection across hosts, containers, and serverless deployments in any cloud, 
throughout the application lifecycle. Prisma Cloud Compute Edition is cloud native and API-enabled, 
protecting all your workloads regardless of their underlying compute technology or the cloud in which they run.

This integration lets you import **Palo Alto Networks - Prisma Cloud Compute** alerts into Cortex XSOAR

## Configure Prisma Cloud Compute to Send Alerts to Cortex XSOAR

To send alerts from Prisma Cloud Compute to Cortex XSOAR, you need to create an alert profile.

1. Log in to your Prisma Cloud Compute console.
2. Navigate to **Manage > Alerts**.
3. Click **Add Profile** to create a new alert profile.
4. On the left, select **Demisto** from the provider list.
5. On the right, select the alert triggers. Alert triggers specify which alerts are sent to Cortex XSOAR.
6. Click **Save** to save the alert profile.

## Configure Prisma Cloud Compute on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Servers & Services**.
2. Search for **Prisma Cloud Compute**.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration.
   
   | Parameter | Description | Example |
   | -------------- | ----------- | ------- |
   | **Name** | A meaningful name for the integration instance. | Prisma Cloud Compute_&lt;alertProfileName&gt; |
   | **Fetches incidents** | Configures this integration instance to fetch alerts from Prisma Cloud Compute. | N/A |
   | **Prisma Cloud Compute Console URL** | URL address and port of your Prisma Cloud Compute console. Copy the address from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute. | https:/<span></span>/proxyserver.com |
   | **Prisma Cloud Compute Project Name (if applicable)** | Copy the project name from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute and enter paste in this field. | N/A |
   | **Trust any certificate (not secure)** | Skips verification of the CA certificate (not recommended). | N/A |
   | **Use system proxy settings** | Runs the integration instance using the proxy server (HTTP or HTTPS) that you defined in the server configuration. | <span></span>https://proxyserver.com |
   | **Credentials** | Prisma Cloud Compute login credentials. | N/A |
   | **Prisma Cloud Compute CA Certificate** | CA Certificate used by Prisma Cloud Compute. Copy the certificate from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute. | N/A |
4. Click **Test** to validate the integration.
5. Click **Done** to save the integration.


Commands
--------

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook. After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
