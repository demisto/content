#### Playbooks


##### Prisma Cloud Compute - Audit Alert v3

- Fixed a logic bug where all hosts results retrieved when no image or host are provided in the incident.
##### Prisma Cloud Compute - Audit Alert Enrichment

- Changed enrichment tasks to not extract indicators.
##### Prisma Cloud Compute - Audit Alert Vulnerabilities Enrichment

- Added a playbook input for controlling which indicators would get created from CVEs based on their severity. The default is "High, Critical". This would reduce the number of indicators created to avoid performance issues.
