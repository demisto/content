#### Integrations

##### Palo Alto Networks - Prisma Cloud Compute

- Updated the ***prisma-cloud-compute-container-scan-results-list*** to support all_results arguments that will provide all results without limiting them. Using this argument may return a lot of results and is not recommended to be used often
- Added new commands:
   - ***prisma-cloud-archive-audit-incident***
   - ***prisma-cloud-compute-runtime-host-audit-events-list***
   - ***prisma-cloud-compute-runtime-container-policy-list***
   - 
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.85667*.
