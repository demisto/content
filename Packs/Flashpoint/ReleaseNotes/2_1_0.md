##### Flashpoint Ignite

- Added the ***flashpoint-ignite-indicator-get*** command to retrieve details for specific indicator of types "url", "domain", "file hash", and "ip" using the indicator ID.
- Updated the following commands to use the new IOC v2 API:
  - ***ip***, ***domain***, ***url***, ***file*** and ***flashpoint-ignite-common-lookup***.
  - Note: The context paths of the commands have been updated as per the IOC v2 API response.
- Added support for the following parameters to filter incoming compromised credentials alerts based on password characteristics:
  - **Fetch compromised credentials alerts having numbers in password**
  - **Fetch compromised credentials alerts having minimum length of password**
  - **Fetch compromised credentials alerts having uppercase in password**
  - **Fetch compromised credentials alerts having lowercase in password**
  - **Fetch compromised credentials alerts having symbol in password**
- Fixed an issue where the ***ip*** command could return a "NoneType" error.
- Deprecated the ***filename*** and ***email*** command.
