Use the Flashpoint Ignite integration to reduce business risk. Ignite allows users to ingest alerts and compromised credentials as incident alerts and executes commands such as search intelligence report, ip, url, get events, and more.
This integration was integrated and tested with API v1 of Ignite.

### Auto Extract Indicator
Both incident types **Ignite Alert** and **Flashpoint Compromised Credentials** support the auto extraction feature by default. This feature extracts indicators and enriches their reputations using commands and scripts defined for the indicator type (Refer to [Indicator Extraction](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.12/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Indicator-Extraction) for more details).

If you are upgrading from a Flashpoint integration, please refer to the [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) for guidance.

## Configure Flashpoint Ignite on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Flashpoint Ignite.

4. To fetch Ignite alerts, refer to the section ["Configuration for fetching Ignite Alerts as a Cortex XSOAR Incident"](#configuration-for-fetching-ignite-alerts-as-a-cortex-xsoar-incident).
5. To fetch Ignite compromised credentials, refer to the section ["Configuration for fetching Ignite Compromised Credentials as a Cortex XSOAR Incident"](#configuration-for-fetching-ignite-compromised-credentials-as-a-cortex-xsoar-incident).

## Configuration for fetching Ignite Alerts as a Cortex XSOAR Incident

1. Select **Fetches incidents**.
2. Under Classifier, select "N/A".
3. Under Incident type, select "Ignite Alert".
4. Under Mapper (incoming), select "Ignite Alert - Incoming Mapper" for default mapping.
5. Enter the connection parameters (Server URL, API key).
6. Under the Fetch Type, select "Alerts".
7. Select "Alert Status" based on your requirement to filter the alerts. By default, it will fetch all status of alerts.
8. Select "Alert Origin" based on your requirement to filter the alerts. By default, it will fetch all origins of alerts.
9. Select "Alert Sources" based on your requirement to filter the alerts. By default, it will fetch all sources of alerts.
10. Select "Severity for Incidents" based on your requirement to set the default severity for the incidents. By default, it will set the Unknown severity for all incidents.
11. Update "First fetch time" and "Max Fetch Count" based on your requirements.

## Configuration for fetching Ignite Compromised Credentials as a Cortex XSOAR Incident

1. Select **Fetches incidents**.
2. Under Classifier, select "N/A".
3. Under Incident type, select "Flashpoint Compromised Credentials".
4. Under Mapper (incoming), select "Flashpoint Compromised Credentials - Incoming Mapper" for default mapping.
5. Enter the connection parameters (Server URL, API key).
6. Under the Fetch Type, select "Compromised Credentials".
7. Select "Fetch fresh compromised credentials alerts" so that it only ingests username/password combinations if they haven't been seen before.
8. Update "First fetch time" and "Max Fetch Count" based on your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: The maximum records to fetch for the given first fetch can not exceed 10,000

- The maximum number of records that can be fetched using the first fetch time is limited to 10,000 by the API.
- To resolve this issue, you can reduce the first fetch time to a shorter time period, ensuring that the total number of records fetched during the specified time falls within the 10,000 limit.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
