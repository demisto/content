## Feodo Tracker IP Blocklist Feed

### Currently Active
- Dridex, Heodo (aka Emotet) and TrickBot botnet command & control servers (C&Cs) reside on compromised servers and servers that have been rent and setup by the botnet herder itself for the sole purpose of botnet hosting. 
- Feodo Tracker offers a bloc klist of IP addresses that are associated with such botnet C&Cs that can be used to detect and block botnet C2 traffic from infected machines towards the internet. 
- An IP address will only get added to the block list if it responds with a valid botnet C2 response. However, a botnet C2 may go offline later.
