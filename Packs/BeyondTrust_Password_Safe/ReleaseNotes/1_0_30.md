#### Integrations
##### BeyondTrust Password Safe
- Added the **beyondtrust-list-release-requests** command.

The "beyondtrust-list-release-requests" command will generate a list of active BeyondTrust requests and return the following information: AccessType, AccountID, AccountName, ApprovedDate, DomainName, ExpiresDate, Reason, RequestID, RequestReleaseDate, Status, SystemID and SystemName.

The command can be run using the following command: beyondtrust-list-release-requests. It does not take in any arguments.

- Modified the **beyondtrust-get-credentials** command

The "beyondtrust-get-credentials" command was also modified to store the retrieved credentials into a context key called "BeyondTrust.Credentials.Password". Previously, the output for the command did not store the retrieved credentials in a key.
