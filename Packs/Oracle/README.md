In order to use the collector to collect events from the vendor, you have 2 options to collect events. In either way, you will need to configure the vendor and product for this specific collector.
1. Broker VM - You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/broker-vm/set-up-broker-vm/configure-your-broker-vm).
You can configure the specific vendor and product for this instance, by going to the Settings -> Configuration -> Data Broker -> Broker VMs. Right-Click, and select Syslog Collector -> Configure.
When configuring the Syslog Collector, set vendor as oracle, product as db.
2. XDRC (XDR Collector) - You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/cortex-xdr-collectors/xdr-collector-datasets#id7f0fcd4d-b019-4959-a43a-40b03db8a8b2).
You can configure the vendor and product by replacing [vendor]_[product]_raw with oracle_db_raw.
When configuring the instance, you should use a yml that configures the vendor and product, like this example for the Microsoft NPS product:

```
filebeat.inputs:
- type: filestream

  paths:
    - c:\windows\system32\logfiles\*.log
  processors:
    - add_fields:
        fields:
          vendor: msft
          product: nps
```
