Dynamic sections allow you to populate content into indicator and incident layouts using an automation script.
The `DisplayIndicatorReputationContent` automation contained in this pack makes it easy to display all reputation information collected for a particular indicator directly on its layout.

The `DisplayTaggedWarroomEntries` automation allows for a tab on an incident layout to be populated with a dynamic section which grabs warroom entries that are tagged with the "report" tag.
An incident level report can then be generated from this tab in the layout.
