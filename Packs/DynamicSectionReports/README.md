Dynamic sections allow you to populate content into indicator and incident layouts using an automation script.
The scripts contained in this pack make it easy to display all reputation information collected for a particular indicator directly on its layout.

A tab on an incident layout can be populated with a dynamic section which grabs warroom entries that are tagged with the "report" tag.
As incident level reports can be generated from any tab on a layout.

For auto extracted and enriched information or for more dynamic tagging it is possible to search entries and tag them using the https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/UpdateEntriesBySearch/ pack.
