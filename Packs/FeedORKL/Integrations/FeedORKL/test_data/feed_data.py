According to public reporting,\nScattered Spider threat actors have [2],[3],[4]:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPosed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain\ncredentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598],[T1656].\nPosed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff to direct employees to run commercial remote\naccess tools enabling initial access [T1204],[T1219],[T1566].\nPosed as IT staff to convince employees to share their one-time password (OTP), an MFA\nauthentication code.\nSent repeated MFA notification prompts leading to employees pressing the “Accept” button\n(also known as MFA fatigue) [T1621].[5]\nConvinced cellular carriers to transfer control of a targeted user’s phone number to a SIM card\nthey controlled, gaining control over the phone and access to MFA prompts.\nMonetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by\nransomware and data theft [T1657].\n\nAfter gaining access to networks, FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly\navailable, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Table 1 details a list of legitimate tools Scattered\nSpider, repurposed and used for their criminal activity. Note: The use of these legitimate tools alone\nis not indicative of criminal activity. Users should review the Scattered Spider indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) and TTPs discussed in this CSA to determine whether they have been\ncompromised.\nTable 1: Legitimate Tools Used by Scattered Spider\n\nTool\n\nIntended Use\n\nFleetdeck.io\n\nEnables remote monitoring and management of systems.\n\nLevel.io\n\nEnables remote monitoring and management of systems.\n\nMimikatz [S0002]\n\nExtracts credentials from a system.\n\nNgrok [S0508]\n\nEnables remote access to a local web server by tunneling over the internet.\n\nPulseway\n\nEnables remote monitoring and management of systems.\n\nScreenconnect\n\nEnables remote connections to network devices for management.\n\nPage 2 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-320A\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nFBI  CISA\n\nTool\n\nIntended Use\n\nSplashtop\n\nEnables remote connections to network devices for management.\n\nTactical.RMM\n\nEnables remote monitoring and management of systems.\n\nTailscale\n\nProvides virtual private networks (VPNs) to secure network communications.\n\nTeamviewer\n\nEnables remote connections to network devices for management.\n\nIn addition to using legitimate tools, Scattered Spider also uses malware as part of its TTPs. See\nTable 2 for some of the malware used by Scattered Spider.\nTable 2: Malware Used by Scattered Spider\n\nMalware\n\nUse\n\nAveMaria (also known as\nWarZone [S0670])\n\nEnables remote access to a victim’s systems.\n\nRaccoon Stealer\n\nSteals information including login credentials [TA0006],\nbrowser history [T1217], cookies [T1539], and other data.\n\nVIDAR Stealer\n\nSteals information including login credentials, browser history,\ncookies, and other data.\n\nScattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off\nthe land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently\nmodifying their TTPs.\nObservably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and\nthreatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites\nincluding U.S.-based data centers and MEGA[.]NZ [T1567.002].\n\nRecent Scattered Spider TTPs\nNew TTP - File Encryption\nMore recently, FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after\nexfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors\ncommunicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications.\n\nPage 3 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-320A\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nFBI  CISA\n\nReconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access\nScattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts\nagainst a target using victim-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3\n[T1583.001].\nTable 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors\n\nDomains\nvictimname-sso[.]com\nvictimname-servicedesk[.]com\nvictimname-okta[.]com\nIn most instances, Scattered Spider threat actors conduct SIM swapping attacks against users that\nrespond to the phishing/smishing attempt. The threat actors then work to identify the personally\nidentifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing,\nobtaining answers for those users’ security questions. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII\n[T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656]\nto convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens\n[T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on\n(SSO) environments.\n\nExecution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation\nScattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after\ncompromising a user’s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a\nfederated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking\n[T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO\naccount attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider\nand then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the\nthreat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords\nare changed [T1078]. Additionally, they leverage common endpoint detection and response (EDR)\ntools installed on the victim networks to take advantage of the tools’ remote-shell capabilities and\nexecuting of commands which elevates their access. They also deploy remote monitoring and\nmanagement (RMM) tools [T1219] to then maintain persistence.\n\nDiscovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration\nOnce persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform\ndiscovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation\n[T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging\ninto Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim’s Active\n\nPage 4 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-320A\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nFBI  CISA\n\nDirectory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim’s code repositories [T1213.003], codesigning certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon\nWeb Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement\n[TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data\nexfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools\n[T1648] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074],[T1530].\nAccording to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat\nactors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks—thereby encrypting\nVMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486].\nTo determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider\nthreat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for\nemails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The\nthreat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to\nidentify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in\nresponse to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the\nenvironment [T1136] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles [T1585.001] to backstop\nnewly created identities.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK

By instituting this practice, an organization limits the severity of disruption\nto its business practices [CPG 2.R].\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to comply with NIST's standards for developing and managing\npassword policies.\no Use longer passwords consisting of at least eight characters and no more than 64\ncharacters in length [CPG 2.B].\no Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\no Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.\no Avoid reusing passwords [CPG 2.C].\no Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 2.G].\no Disable password “hints.”\no Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.\nNote: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and\nfrequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users\ndeveloping password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.\no Require administrator credentials to install software.\nRequire phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent\npossible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access\ncritical systems [CPG 2.H].\nKeep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.
