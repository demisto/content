A PassiveTotal with Security Intelligence Services Feed provides you with newly observed Domain, Malware, Phishing, Content, and Scam Blacklist with Hourly ingestion available.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of Security Intelligence Services Feed.

The XSOAR instance with **ElasticSearch** is required as this integration would ingest large amount of indicators from SIS to XSOAR.

For that same reason, in case this integration fails to fetch indicators with timeout error, the `feedIntegrationScript.timeout` configuration should be configured with value 45 or more.
## Configure Security Intelligence Services Feed on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Security Intelligence Services Feed.
