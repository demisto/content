Together, DomainTools and Cortex XSOAR automate and orchestrate the incident response processes with essential domain profile, web crawl, SSL, and infrastructure dat delivered by the DomainTools Iris Investigate API. SOCs can create custom, automated workflows to trigger Indicator of Compromise (IoC) investigations, block threats based on connected infrastructure, and identify potentially malicious incidents befor weaponization.

**With the DomainTools Classic App for Cortex XSOAR, the DomainTools Enterprise APIs are available not only for ad-hoc War-Room investigations on specific incidents, but also for automated actions.**
