#### Integrations
##### IPQualityScore
- Bug fixes for two issues:
    - The URL lookup functionality currently doesn't pull the correct value. It should pull risk_score instead of fraud_score.
    - The Email lookup functionality did not URL encode all emails. This could lead to malformed results. The Email lookup functionality now encodes all emails.
