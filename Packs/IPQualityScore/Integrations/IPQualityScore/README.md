### email
***
Runs reputation on email addresses.


#### Base Command

`email`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| email | Email address to check. | Required | 


#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPQualityScore.Email.message | String | A generic status message, either success or some form of an error notice. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.success | Boolean | Was the request successful? | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.valid | Boolean | Does this email address appear valid? | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.disposable | Boolean | Is this email suspected of belonging to a temporary or disposable mail service? Usually associated with fraudsters and scammers. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.smtp_score | Number | Validity score of email server's SMTP setup. Range: "-1" - "3". Scores above "-1" can be associated with a valid email. -1 = invalid email address 0 = mail server exists, but is rejecting all mail 1 = mail server exists, but is showing a temporary error 2 = mail server exists, but accepts all email 3 = mail server exists and has verified the email address | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.overall_score | Number | Overall email validity score. Range: "0" - "4". Scores above "1" can be associated with a valid email. 0 = invalid email address 1 = dns valid, unreachable mail server 2 = dns valid, temporary mail rejection error 3 = dns valid, accepts all mail 4 = dns valid, verified email exists | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.first_name | String | Suspected first name based on email. Returns "CORPORATE" if the email is suspected of being a generic company email. Returns "UNKNOWN" if the first name was not determinable. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.generic | Boolean | Is this email suspected as being a catch all or shared email for a domain? \("admin@", "webmaster@", "newsletter@", "sales@", "contact@", etc.\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.common | Boolean | Is this email from a common email provider? \("gmail.com", "yahoo.com", "hotmail.com", etc.\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.dns_valid | Boolean | Does the email's hostname have valid DNS entries? Partial indication of a valid email. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.honeypot | Boolean | Is this email believed to be a "honeypot" or "SPAM trap"? Bulk mail sent to these emails increases your risk of being blacklisted by large ISPs &amp; ending up in the spam folder. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.deliverability | String | How likely is this email to be delivered to the user and land in their mailbox. Values can be "high", "medium", or "low".	 | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.frequent_complainer | Boolean | Indicates if this email frequently unsubscribes from marketing lists or reports email as SPAM. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.spam_trap_score | String | Confidence level of the email address being an active SPAM trap. Values can be "high", "medium", "low", or "none". We recommend scrubbing emails with "high" or "medium" statuses. Avoid "low" emails whenever possible for any promotional mailings. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.catch_all | Boolean | Is this email likely to be a "catch all" where the mail server verifies all emails tested against it as valid? It is difficult to determine if the address is truly valid in these scenarios, since the email's server will not confirm the account's status. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.timed_out | Boolean | Did the connection to the mail service provider timeout during the verification? If so, we recommend increasing the "timeout" variable above the default 7 second value. Lookups that timeout with a "valid" result as false are most likely false and should be not be trusted. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.suspect | Boolean | This value indicates if the mail server is currently replying with a temporary error and unable to verify the email address. This status will also be true for "catch all" email addresses as defined below. If this value is true, then we suspect the "valid" result may be tainted and there is not a guarantee that the email address is truly valid. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.recent_abuse | Boolean | This value will indicate if there has been any recently verified abuse across our network for this email address. Abuse could be a confirmed chargeback, fake signup, compromised device, fake app install, or similar malicious behavior within the past few days. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.fraud_score | Number | The overall Fraud Score of the user based on the email's reputation and recent behavior across the IPQS threat network. Fraud Scores &gt;= 75 are suspicious, but not necessarily fraudulent. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.suggested_domain | String | Default value is "N/A". Indicates if this email's domain should in fact be corrected to a popular mail service. This field is useful for catching user typos. For example, an email address with "gmai.com", would display a suggested domain of "gmail.com". This feature supports all major mail service providers. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.leaked | Boolean | Was this email address associated with a recent database leak from a third party? Leaked accounts pose a risk as they may have become compromised during a database breach.	 | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.domain_age.human | Date | A human description of when this domain was registered. \(Ex: 3 months ago\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.domain_age.timestamp | Number | The unix time since epoch when this domain was first registered. \(Ex: 1568061634\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.domain_age.iso | Date | The time this domain was registered in ISO8601 format \(Ex: 2019-09-09T16:40:34-04:00\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.first_seen.human | Date | A human description of the email address age, using an estimation of the email creation date when IPQS first discovered this email address. \(Ex: 3 months ago\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.first_seen.timestamp | Number | The unix time since epoch when this email was first analyzed by IPQS. \(Ex: 1568061634\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.first_seen.iso | Date | The time this email was first analyzed by IPQS in ISO8601 format \(Ex: 2019-09-09T16:40:34-04:00\) | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.sanitized_email | String | Sanitized email address with all aliases and masking removed, such as multiple periods for Gmail.com. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.request_id | String | A unique identifier for this request that can be used to lookup the request details or send a postback conversion notice. | 
| IPQualityScore.Email.address | String | The email address that was queried | 
| DBotScore.Indicator | String | The indicator that was tested. | 
| DBotScore.Score | Number | The actual score. | 
| DBotScore.Type | String | The indicator type. | 
| DBotScore.Vendor | String | The vendor used to calculate the score. |
