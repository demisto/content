    "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware, both on-premises and multiplatform, could allow a remote attacker to delete or change the configuration, execute commands as the root user, conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface, view passwords, conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, or reboot the device.\r\n\r\nFor more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, there is a mitigation that addresses some of these vulnerabilities for Cisco ATA 191 on-premises firmware only.\r\n\r\n",
