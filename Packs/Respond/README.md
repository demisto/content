This pack pulls open investigations created by Mandiant Automated Defense (MAD) into XSOAR. On top of pulling valuable data created by MAD into XSOAR, a user can assign someone to the investigation, change the investigation description, and close an investigation all from the XSOAR UI.

The pack has several commands 
- mad-get-incident - get a specific investigation, open or closed, from MAD
- mad-assign-user - assign a specific user to an investigation
- mad-remove-user - remove a specific user from an investigation
- mad-close-incident - close a specific investigation

Bi-directional mirroring is supported.

Currently, this pack has no playbooks.
