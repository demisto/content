This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of Prisma SASE API.

## Configure Prisma SASE on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Common Services** > **Identity & Access** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Add or create a service account with the proper privileges.
3. Make a note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  These will be used to configure the integration.

The TSG ID represents the specific Prisma Access tenant that will be targeted for each API call.  
Configure a default TSG_ID to be used for API calls.

The TSG can be specified per command which allows a single service account to access multiple Prisma Access tenants.
