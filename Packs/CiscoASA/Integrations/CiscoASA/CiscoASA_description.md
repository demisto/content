## Configuring Cisco ASA

---
Install and enable Cisco ASA API using the guide [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/api/qsg-asa-api.html#56532).
You **must** install the API in order to run the integration from Cortex XSOAR.
If you are using ASAv (Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance) don't forget to check the ASAv box.
