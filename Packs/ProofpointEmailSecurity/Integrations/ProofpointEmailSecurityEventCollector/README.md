1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Proofpoint Email Security Event Collector.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Server Host | True |
    | Cluster ID | True |
    | API key | True |
    | Fetch interval in seconds | True |
    | Use system proxy settings | False |
    | Event types to fetch | False |

4. Select **Long running instance**.
5. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Commands

### proofpoint-es-get-last-run-results

***
Retrieves the results of a connection attempt to Proofpoint, indicating whether it was successful or failed and why. If event fetching has been initiated, this command provides the results of the most recent fetch attempt.

### proofpoint-es-get-events

***
Retrieves events from Proofpoint Email Security PoD archive for a specified time range to backfill gaps in fetched events. This command is intended for debugging purposes and may result in duplicate events in the Cortex XSIAM dataset. Consult with engineering before using. HTTP 409 (Conflict) errors may be raised if long running execution is active.

#### Base Command

`proofpoint-es-get-events`

#### Input

| **Argument** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| since_time | The start of the time range to fetch events from. E.g., '3 days ago', '2025-01-01T10:00:00'. Rounds down to the nearest hour. | Required |
| to_time | The end of the time range to fetch events from. E.g., 'now', '2025-01-01T11:00:00'. Rounds up to the nearest hour. | Required |
| timezone_offset | The UTC timezone offset in hours to apply to the since_time and to_time arguments. E.g. -5 for UTC-5. | Optional |
| event_types | A comma-separated list of event types to fetch. If not provided, all types will be retrieved. | Optional |
| should_push_events | If true, the command will push the events to the Cortex XSIAM dataset; otherwise, it will only display them. | Optional |

#### Context Output

There is no context output for this command.

## Known Limitations

The API does not allow use of the same token for more than one session at the same time. If you need to open more than one simultaneous connection to receive the same type of data, additional token(s) must be requested.

## Troubleshooting

If there are ingestion delays or events are missing, it's recommended to configure separate instances per event type.
