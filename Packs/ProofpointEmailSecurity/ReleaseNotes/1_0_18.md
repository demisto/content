##### Proofpoint Email Security Event Collector

- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for handling HTTP 409 (Conflict) errors when fetching events.
- Added support for the ***proofpoint-es-get-events*** command that retrieves events from the Proofpoint Email Security PoD archive for a specified time range. This command should be used with caution after reviewing the integration documentation.
- **Breaking changes**: The "Fetch Events" checkbox should be checked to enable the fetching of new events.
