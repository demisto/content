## Known Limitations
---
- When not creating an Maltiverse account there is a limit of 20 API calls per day.
  A free account grants 100 API calls per day.
  Please see https://maltiverse.com/plans for more information about the different plans.
- URL command: When running the !url command, an URL may be followed by a '/' at the end. Maltiverse requires this 
  '/' but it might cause the indicator to not show in the war room.
