    outputs:
    - contextPath: CriminalIP.Domain_Lite
      description: Returns the results of /v1/domain/lite/scan. For more details, please refer to [Criminal IP API /v1/domain/lite/scan](https://www.criminalip.io/developer/api/get-domain-lite-scan)

      name: scan_id
      required: True
      type: String
    description: |-
      You can check the progress of the Lite Scan. 
      Before executing this Command, you must first run domain-lite-scan and take the resulting scan_id as an argument.
      The Lite Scan may take 2 to 5 seconds. 
      Therefore, it is recommended to use [GenericPolling](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/playbooks/generic-polling). 
      For an example of this, please refer to the Criminal IP Run Micro ASM playbook.
    name: domain-lite-scan-status

      type: String
    description: |-
      Full Scan usually takes time, so this checks whether a scan for the domain has been performed within the last 7 days. 
      If there is a scan history within the last 7 days, the user can receive the scan_id of the most recent scan results.
    name: check-last-scan-date
    outputs:
    - contextPath: CriminalIP.Scan_Date
      description: |-
        Checks the recent scan history and returns the results.
        If the value is True, it means that a Full Scan has been conducted within the last 7 days.
        It also returns the scan_id of the scan that was performed.
        In this case, the user can obtain the scan results by executing domain-full-scan-result directly through the returned scan_id without having to proceed with domain-full-scan.

      With this scan_id, you can check the scan progress through domain-full-scan-status and receive scan results through domain-full-scan-result. 
      Full Scan may take longer than Lite Scan as it scans the Domain more comprehensively.
    name: domain-full-scan
    outputs:
    - contextPath: CriminalIP.Full_Scan

      In case of conducting a Domain Full Scan, this creates an Email Body to send an overview report of notable findings from the Full Scan results via email. 
      You can see an example of this command in the Criminal IP Check Malicious Domain playbook
    name: domain-full-scan-make-email-body
    outputs:
    - contextPath: CriminalIP.Email_Body

      Performs functions similar to ASM(Attack Surface Management) for a Domain where a Full scan has been completed. 
      If there are any unusual findings in the results, it generates and returns a summary report. 

      The following items are checked for the domain
      - CVEs on the Domain and its mapped IPs
      - Open ports other than 80/443 on the Domain and its mapped IPs
      - Any certificates for the Domain are expiring within 1 month
      - Abuse Records on the Domain
      - Critical or Dangerous IPs in the Network Logs for the Domain
      - Executable files in the Network Logs for the domain
