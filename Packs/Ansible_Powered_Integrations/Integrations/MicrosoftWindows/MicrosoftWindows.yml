        The `win-dsc` module takes in multiple free form options based on the DSC resource being invoked by `resource_name`.
        There is no option actually named `free_form` so see the examples.
        This module will try and convert the option to the correct type required by the DSC resource and throw a warning if it fails.
        If the type of the DSC resource option is a `CimInstance` or `CimInstance[]`, this means the value should be a dictionary or list of dictionaries based on the values required by that option.
        If the type of the DSC resource option is a `PSCredential` then there needs to be 2 options set in the Ansible task definition suffixed with `_username` and `_password`.
        If the type of the DSC resource option is an array, then a list should be provided but a comma separated string also work. Use a list where possible as no escaping is required and it works with more complex types list `CimInstance[]`.
        If the type of the DSC resource option is a `DateTime`, you should use a string in the form of an ISO 8901 string to ensure the exact date is used.
        Since Ansible 2.8, Ansible will now validate the input fields against the DSC resource definition automatically. Older versions will silently ignore invalid fields.

        You can also set the attributes of child elements like cpu and processModel, see the examples to see how it is done.

        managedPipelineMode may be either "Integrated" or "Classic".
        startMode may be either "OnDemand" or "AlwaysRunning".
        Use `state` module parameter to modify the state of the app pool.
        When trying to set 'processModel.password' and you receive a 'Value does fall within the expected range' error, you have a corrupted keystore. Please follow `http://structuredsight.com/2014/10/26/im-out-of-range-youre-out-of-range/` to help fix your host.

        An explicit encoding can be passed as a string that is a valid value to pass to the .NET framework System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding() method - see `https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding%28v=vs.110%29.aspx`.
        This is mostly useful with `create=yes` if you want to create a new file with a specific encoding. If `create=yes` is specified without a specific encoding, the default encoding (UTF-8, no BOM) will be used.
