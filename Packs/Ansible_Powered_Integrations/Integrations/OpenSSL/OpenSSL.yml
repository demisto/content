        The `assertonly` provider will not generate files and fail if the certificate file is missing.
        The `assertonly` provider has been deprecated in Ansible 2.9 and will be removed in Ansible 2.13. Please see the examples on how to emulate it with `openssl_certificate_info`, `openssl_csr_info`, `openssl_privatekey_info` and `assert`.
        The `entrust` provider was added for Ansible 2.9 and requires credentials for the `https://www.entrustdatacard.com/products/categories/ssl-certificates,Entrust Certificate Services` (ECS) API.

        The permissions the resulting file or directory should have.
        For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
        Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
        As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
        As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string `preserve`.
        When set to `preserve` the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.

        Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
        By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
        This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
        IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.

        For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
        Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
        As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
        As of Ansible 2.6, the mode may also be the special string `preserve`.
        When set to `preserve` the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.

        Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file.
        By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
        This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
        IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
