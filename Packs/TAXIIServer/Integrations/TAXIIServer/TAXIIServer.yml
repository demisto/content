- additionalinfo: Runs the service on this port from within Cortex XSOAR. Requires a unique port for each long-running integration instance. Do not use the same port for multiple instances. (For Cortex XSOAR 8 and Cortex XSIAM) If you do not enter a Listen Port, an unused port for the EDL will automatically be generated when the instance is saved. However, if using an engine, you must enter a Listen Port.
