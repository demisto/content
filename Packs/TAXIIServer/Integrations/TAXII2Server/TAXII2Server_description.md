## TAXII2 Service Integration

This integration provides TAXII2 Services for system indicators (Outbound feed).
You can choose to use TAXII v2.0 or TAXII v2.1.

## Configure Collections
Each TAXII collection in the integration is represented by a Cortex XSOAR indicator query.

The collections are defined by a JSON object in the following format:
```json
{
  "collection1_name":{
    "query": "<Cortex XSOAR indicator query>",
    "description": "<Custom collection description>"
  },
  "collection2_name": "<Cortex XSOAR indicator query>"
}
```
You can add a collection description as is doen in `collection1_name`, or enter only a collection query, as in `collection2_name`.


## How to Access the TAXII Service

(For Cortex XSOAR 6.x) Use one of the following options:
- **https://*xsoar_address*/instance/execute/*instance_name/{taxii2_api_endpoint}/**
- **http://*xsoar_address*:*listen_port/{taxii2_api_endpoint}/**

(For Cortex XSOAR 8 or Cortex XSIAM):
- `https://ext-<tenant>.crtx.<region>.paloaltonetworks.com/xsoar/instance/execute/<instance-name>/<taxii2_api_endpoint>/`
  When running on an engine:  `http://<xsoar_address>:<listen_port>/<taxii2_api_endpoint>/`
  

## Access the TAXII Service by Instance Name
To access the TAXII service by instance name, make sure *Instance execute external* is enabled. 

1. In Cortex XSOAR, go to **Settings > About > Troubleshooting**.
2. (For Cortex XSOAR 6.x only) In the **Server Configuration** section, verify that the *instance.execute.external* key is set to *true*. If this key does not exist, click **+ Add Server Configuration** and add the *instance.execute.external* and set the value to *true*.
3. You can now trigger the webhook URL:

   - (For Cortex XSOAR 6) In a web browser, go to https://*<xsoar_address>*/instance/execute/*<instance_name>* .
   -  (For Cortex XSOAR 8 or Cortex XSIAM) `https://ext-<tenant>.crtx.<region>.paloaltonetworks.com/xsoar/instance/execute/<instance-name>`


## How to use HTTPS
To use HTTPS, a certificate and private key have to be supplied in the integration configuration. 

## How to use authentication
The integration allows the use of basic authentication in the requests.
To enable basic authentication, a user and password have to be supplied in the Credentials parameters in the integration configuration.

The server will then authenticate the requests by the `Authorization` header, expecting basic authentication encrypted in base64 to match the given credentials.
