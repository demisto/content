## Zoom and Zoom IAM Integrations
In order to use these integrations, you need to enter your Zoom credentials in the relevant integration instance parameters.
There are two authentication methods available: **OAuth** and **JWT**(deprecated).

Please login to your Zoom admin user account, and follow these steps:

- Use the following account credentials to get an access token:
    Account ID
    Client ID
    Client secret

### Troubleshooting - OAuth
Important nots:
- You must have your app activated for the OAuth authentication method.
- Your API token is generated based on the permission you give it, AKA scopes.
- If you initially allow cretin permissions, and now you deleted those permissions, your token is still valid with the previous permissions, only after 1 our the oldest token will expire and a new and limited token will be generated.
- If you want to kill the tokens permissions  immediately, you can deactivate your app.
