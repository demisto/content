### Rate Limits
To prevent abuse and ensure service stability, all API requests are rate limited. Rate limits specify the maximum number of API calls that can be made in a minute period. The exact number of calls that your application can make per minute varies based on company plan. 
For more information, please refer to the Zoom API documentation on [Rate limits by account type](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/rate-limits/#rate-limits-by-account-type).
