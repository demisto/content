##### Unit 42 Feed

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.12.6391686*.
- Added the **Indicator Fetch Limit** parameter to allow users to configure the maximum total number of indicators to fetch per feed run. The limit is distributed equally among all active types (Threat Objects, IP, Domain, URL, File), with the last type (File) receiving any remaining quota.
