##### Cisco Email Security (beta)
- Fixed an issue where test-module failed on an incorrect timeout argument.
- In the ***email messages search*** command the timestamp column is now the first column.
- Updated the descriptions for the **start date** and **end date** arguments in the ***email report get*** command to state that the minutes and seconds needs to be "00".
- Added the *device group name* argument to the ***email report get*** command. The argument's initial value is **Hosted_Cluster**. Also fixed an issue where this command always returned the results as zero.
