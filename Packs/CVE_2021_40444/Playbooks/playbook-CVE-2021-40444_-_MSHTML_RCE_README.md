CVE-2021-4044 refers to the MSHTML engine, that has been found vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by a specially crafted Microsoft Office document or rich text format file. 

Mitigations:
* Microsoft official patch addressing CVE-2021-40444 
* Several workarounds suggested by Microsoft.

Researchers have validated this attack triggered in Windows Explorer with “Preview Mode” enabled, even in just a rich-text format RTF file (not an Office file and without ActiveX). This indicates it can be exploited even without opening the file and this invalidates Microsoft’s workaround mitigation mentioned above.

This playbook should be trigger manually and includes the following tasks: 

* Collect related known indicators from several sources.
* Indicators, Files and Process creation patterns hunting using PAN-OS, Cortex XDR and SIEM products.
* Block indicators automatically or manually.
* Provide workarounds and detection capabilities.
* Microsoft official CVE-2021-40444 patch.
