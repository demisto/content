## MITRE ATT&CK
_____

Select which domains you would like to pull indicators from. Additionally, each domain has a subset of "concepts". Most of the domains have all of the concepts, with the exception of the "PRE-ATT&CK" domain. There are only a small subset of "concepts" within this domain. Any concept that does not exist will be skipped.

Note: When upgrading from v1 (MITRE IDs Feed) to v2 (MITRE ATT&CK) - disabling the MITRE IDs Feed indicator type, and instance are important for the smooth flow of the upgrade.
