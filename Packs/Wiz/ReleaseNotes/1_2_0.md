#### Integrations
##### Wiz
- Added support for dual authenticaion mode. Since Wiz is shifting from our legacy authentication provider (Auth0) to Amazon Cognito, this integration now supports both authentication endpoints.
    - The user now needs to configure the authentication endpoint of their tenant. The authentication endpoint is unique to the environment (e.g., commercial, gov) and authentication provider
    - The integration assesses the authentication endpoint and based on that chooses the correct authentication payload to go with it
    - Existing integrations that upgrade to 1.2.0 will need to add an authentication endpoint after the upgrade
- Added human readable outputs to Commands
