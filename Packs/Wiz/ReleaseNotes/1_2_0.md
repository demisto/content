#### Integrations
##### Wiz
- Added support for dual authentication mode. Since Wiz is shifting from our legacy authentication provider (Auth0) to Amazon Cognito, this integration now supports both authentication endpoints, we actually support any authentication endpoint now.
- The user now needs to configure the authentication endpoint of their tenant. The authentication endpoint is unique to the environment (e.g., commercial, gov) and authentication provider
- The integration assesses the authentication endpoint and based on that chooses the correct authentication payload to go with it
- Existing integrations that upgrade to 1.2.0 will need to add an authentication endpoint after the upgrade
