##### New: File Analysis - ReversingLabs A1000
- Created a new playbook that checks for sample analysis results on the ReversingLabs A1000 malware analysis appliance. If the sample does not exist on A1000, the playbook uploads the sample to ReversingLabs A1000 and automatically retrieves the detailed and classification reports.
