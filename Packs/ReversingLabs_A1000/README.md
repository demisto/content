## What is the ReversingLabs A1000 Cortex XSOAR integration pack?
ReversingLabs A1000 Malware Analysis Appliance integrates the ReversingLabs game-changing TitaniumCore
automated static analysis technology and the TitaniumCloud File Reputation Service database. The REST Services APIs enable analysts to input suspected samples, access unpacked files and view extracted Proactive Threat Indicators (PTIs). The A1000 also calculates each fileâ€™s Threat Level to help with determination of remediation priorities. The platform performs an in-depth static analysis of a comprehensive array of file types including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, email attachments, documents and
firmware.
