#### Cortex XSOAR Azure App

In order to use the Cortex XSOAR Azure application, use the default application ID (ab217a43-e09b-4f80-ae93-482fc7a3d1a3).

You only need to fill in your subscription ID and resource group name. For more details, follow [Azure Integrations Parameters](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#azure-integrations-params).

#### Self-Deployed Azure App

To use a self-configured Azure application, you need to add a [new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#register-a-new-application-using-the-azure-portal).

* The application must have **user_impersonation** permission (can be found in *API permissions* section of the Azure Kubernetes Services app registrations).
* The application must allow **public client flows** (can be found under the *Authentication* section of the Azure Kubernetes Services app registrations).
