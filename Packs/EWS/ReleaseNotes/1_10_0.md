#### Mappers
##### EWS - Incoming Mapper
- Adding the "Phishing Reporter Email Headers" field.
- **BREAKING FIX**: Disassociate "Email Headers" field since it represents the original email headers and not the reporter headers.

#### Playbooks
##### New: Get Original Email - EWS v2
This v2 playbook retrieves the original email in the thread as an eml file, by using the EWS v2 integration.

This playbook will retrieve the email as eml and not as an Email object (like the previous version). This version also reduces the amount of tasks needed to perform the fetch action.

You must have the necessary permissions in the EWS integration to execute global search: eDiscovery.
