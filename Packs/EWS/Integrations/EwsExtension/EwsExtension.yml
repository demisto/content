        This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message.
        The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way.
        Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example,"d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@DM3NAM06BG401.Eop-nam06.prod.protection.outlook.com").

      Searches message data for the last 10 days. If you run this command without any arguments, only data from the last 48 hours is returned.
      If you enter a start date that is older than 10 days, you will receive an error and the command will return no results.
      This command returns a maximum of 1,000,000 results, and will timeout on very large queries. If your query returns too many results, consider splitting it up using shorter start_date and end_date intervals.
