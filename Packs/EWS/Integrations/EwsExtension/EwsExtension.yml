        The message_id parameter filters the results by the Message-ID header field of the message.
        This value is also known as the Client ID. The format of the Message-ID depends on the messaging server that sent the message.
        The value should be unique for each message. However, not all messaging servers create values for the Message-ID in the same way.
        Be sure to include the full Message ID string (which may include angle brackets) and enclose the value in quotation marks (for example,"d9683b4c-127b-413a-ae2e-fa7dfb32c69d@DM3NAM06BG401.Eop-nam06.prod.protection.outlook.com").

        enter 09/01/2018 to specify September 1, 2018. You can enter the date only, or you can enter the date and time of day.
        If you enter the date and time of day, enclose the value in quotation marks ("), for example, "09/01/2018 5:00 PM".

          * Failed: Message delivery was attempted and it failed or the message was filtered as spam or malware, or by transport rules.
          * Pending: Message delivery is underway or was deferred and is being retried.
          * Delivered: The message was delivered to its destination.
          * Expanded: There was no message delivery because the message was addressed to a distribution group and the membership of the distribution was expanded.
          * Quarantined: The message was quarantined.
          * FilteredAsSpam: The message was marked as spam.

      Searches message data for the last 10 days. If you run this command without any arguments, only data from the last 48 hours is returned.
      If you enter a start date that is older than 10 days, you will receive an error and the command will return no results.
      This command returns a maximum of 1,000,000 results, and will timeout on very large queries. If your query returns too many results, consider splitting it up using shorter start_date and end_date intervals.
