## Setting Up the Instance

### Step 1: Generate Client ID and Client Secret

1. Register your application as a new client by accessing the developer console.
2. Choose Self client as application type.
3. After choosing the client type, provide the required details and click 'Create'. On successful registration, you will be provided with a set of OAuth 2.0 credentials such as `Client_ID` and `Client_Secret` that will be only known to Zoho and your application. (Do not share this credentials anywhere).

### Step 2: Authorization by generating the grant token

After generating `Client_ID` and `Client_Secret`, a grant code has to be generated.
Self Client Method - For Self Client type.

- After registration, click the `Self Client` method available on the Applications list.
- Enter a valid scope: DesktopCentralCloud.Admin.READ

Click Create to generate `Code`.
