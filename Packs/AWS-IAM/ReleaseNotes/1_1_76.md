##### AWS - Identity and Access Management
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/boto3py3:1.0.0.5533693*.
- 
- Added support for the **aws-iam-update-account-password-policy-quick-action** command, which updates the password policy to require a minimum length of 14 characters, at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one symbol. It allows users to reset passwords, prevents reuse of the last 24 passwords, and sets password expiration to 90 days.
