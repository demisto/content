Note: This is a beta Integration, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the integration is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the integration during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the integration to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.

The integration is in beta because it only covers a subset of the endpoints and API use cases.
