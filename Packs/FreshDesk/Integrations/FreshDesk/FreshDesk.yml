      Returns a list of all tickets that match the filter criteria. If
      no filters are specified, all tickets from the last 30 days are returned.
      Note that this command can consume multiple API credits - this can occur
      if the count of tickets resulting from your query exceeds 30 - in that instance
      this command makes additional calls to the API to retrieve additional tickets
      matching your query.
