## Carbon Black Cloud Endpoint Standard

*Carbon Black Cloud Endpoint Standard is the new name for the product formerly called CB Defense.*

### Create Access Levels and API Keys

In this integration we use 2 rest API's with 2 different permissions. One for the policies commands and another for the rest all commands. Therefore, in addition to creating a Live Response API key and Live Response API secret key (for the policies commands), you also need to create a custom API key and a custom API secret key (for the rest all commands), with a custom access level.

#### Create a Custom Access Level

1. In the Carbon Black Cloud console, go to **Settings** > **API Access** > **Access Levels** tab.
2. Open the *Add Access Level* panel. 
2. Give the access level a unique name (you will need this for creating your API Key) and a description.
3. In the table, scroll down until you see your API service category. Configure the required permissions. Some service categories have multiple
   permissions that can be configured.

#### Create an API Key

1. In the Carbon Black Cloud console, go to **Settings** > **API Access** > **API Keys** tab.
2. Select **Add API Key** from the far right.
3. Give the API key a unique name, and select the appropriate access level. If you select
   "Custom", you will need to choose the Access Level you created in [Create a Custom Access Level](#create-a-custom-access-level).
4. Click **Save**. You will be provided with your API key credentials:
   - API Secret Key
   - API Key

### Set the API keys
#### If you use credentials:
   - Username => api key & password => secret api key
   - The first credentials is for **Custom** api access level (all commands except the policies commands), the second credentials is for **Live Response** access level (the policies commands)

#### If you don't use credentials:
   - api key => api key & password => secret api key
   
### Create a Carbon Black Query

Carbon Black Cloud Endpoint Standard uses Advanced Search Queries to query for events and processes. Click [here](https://developer.carbonblack.com/resources/query_overview.pdf) for more information
about Advanced Search Queries.
