      "description": "Certificates are used to authenticate (confirm the identity) when establishing online communication channels. The authentication relies on chain of trust. By trusting the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate to the third-party, and assuming that it verifies the identity behind each certificate, trusting a limited set of CAs, allows to trust millions of entities. However, some CAs do not perform identity auditing before issuing a certificate (e.g., to support encryption). Relying on such CAs, makes the forge of your certificate easier and reduces your credability.",
