#### Playbooks
##### Port Scan - Generic
- Fixed issues where some playbook inputs were not used in the subplaybooks. The original functionality of the playbook should not be affected.

##### Port Scan - External Source
- Fixed an issue where the external IPs were not properly being pivoted or used in the reverse IP lookup.
