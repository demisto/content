### Amazon Security Lake

Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from AWS environments, SaaS providers, on premises, cloud sources, and third-party sources into a purpose-built data lake that's stored in your AWS account.
Security Lake helps you analyze security data, so you can get a more complete understanding of your security posture across the entire organization. With Security Lake, you can also improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data.

The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you retain ownership over your data.
