Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.34.20 of AWS Security Lake SDK (boto3).

## Configure AWS-SecurityLake on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for AWS-SecurityLake.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Name | User name | True |
    | Role Arn | Role ARN | False |

    | Role Session Duration | Role Session Duration | False |
    | AWS Default Region | AWS Default Region | False |
    | Access Key | Access Key | False |
    | Secret Key | Secret Key | False |
    | Timeout | The time in seconds until a timeout exception is reached. You can specify just the read timeout (for example 60) or also the connect timeout followed after a comma (for example 60,10). If a connect timeout is not specified, a default of 10 second will be used. | False |
    | Retries | The maximum number of retry attempts when connection or throttling errors are encountered. Set to 0 to disable retries. The default value is 5 and the limit is 10. Note: Increasing the number of retries will increase the execution time. | False |
