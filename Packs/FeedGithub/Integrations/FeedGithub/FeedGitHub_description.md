The integration supports the following workflow:

- Publication of indicators from a specific repo.

 To access the requested repository, you need to provide
 the owner(username), repo(repository) name, and API key as parameters for the
 integration.

#### It is recommended to use Api Token in order to avoid being rate limited.

To generate your personal access token, visit:[GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
