#### Integrations

##### IBM QRadar v3

- Fixed an issue where the integration context would continuously accumulate new samples, increasing memory consumption and resulting in "http.max_content_length Exceeded" errors.
- Added support for **qradar-debug-snapshot** command that returns a redacted snapshot of integration context metrics (queued, inprogress, finished, meta sizes, concurrent active, samples count).
