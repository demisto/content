#### Integrations

##### IBM QRadar v3

- Fixed an issue where the continuous accumulation of sample incidents in the integration context led to high memory consumption, causing the integration to stop fetching new incidents.
- Added support for **qradar-print-context** command that returns a redacted snapshot of integration context metrics (queued, inprogress, finished, meta sizes, concurrent active, samples count).
