#### Integrations
##### IBM QRadar v3
- Improved events retry mechanism of `fetch-incidents`.
- Improved performance of mirroring of the events.
- Added the number of fetched events in the offense context in they key `events_fetched`
- Fixed ignoring the order of evaluation of `user_query` with adding parentheses.

#### Mappers
##### QRadar - Generic Incoming Mapper
- Fixed the number of fetched events, which previously ignored the `eventcount` per event. 

#### Scripts
##### QRadarPrintEvents
- The widget now shows just the first 10 events. Previously the widget would fail to load when too many events were fetched.
