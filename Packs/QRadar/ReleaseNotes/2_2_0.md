##### IBM QRadar v3
- Improved the events retry mechanism for the ***fetch-incidents*** command.
- Improved the performance for mirroring of events.
- Added the number of fetched events in the offense context under the field `events_fetched`.
- Fixed an issue where the order of evaluation for the `user_query` by adding parentheses.

#### Mappers
##### QRadar - Generic Incoming Mapper
- Fixed the number of fetched events, which previously ignored the `eventcount` per event. 

#### Scripts
##### QRadarPrintEvents
- The widget now shows only the first 10 events. Previously, the widget would fail to load when too many events were fetched.
