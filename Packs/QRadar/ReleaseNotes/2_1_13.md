#### Playbooks
##### New: QRadar - Get Offense Logs
- Works for QRadar integrations versions 2 and 3, v1 is deprecated.

Note that for QRadar v2 and v3 you can use the integration to fetch the events with the offense however it will fetch the events according to the specified limit defined in the instance settings. By using this playbook you can define an additional search to query a larger number of logs.

Default playbook inputs use the QRadar incident fields such as idoffense, starttime. These fields can be replaced but need to point to relevant offense ID and starttime fields.  (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).

##### QRadarCorrelationLog

##### QRadar - Get offense correlations v2
