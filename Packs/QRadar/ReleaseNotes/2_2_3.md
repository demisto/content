#### Integrations
##### IBM QRadar v3
- Added a new command **qradar-search-retrieve-events**. Get QRadar events in a single command.
- Added an option to create a search with `offense_id` and override the instance parameters in **qradar-create-search**.
- Fixed an issue where multiple events search failures in a single fetch would reset the existing integration context.
- Changed the START in the search query when fetching an offense's events to the *offense start time*. This change was done to improve fetch performance.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.5.31928*.
