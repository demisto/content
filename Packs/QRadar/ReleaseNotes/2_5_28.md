##### IBM QRadar v3

- Reduced memory consumption and fixed "Query does not exist" HTTP 404 errors caused by the accumulation of stale offense search IDs in the integration context.
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for fetching rule names associated with QRadar offenses.
- Fixed an issue where the integration would stop fetching incidents after running the ***qradar-reset-last-run*** command.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.11.4819260*.
