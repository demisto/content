### Using API Token authentication
To use the integration with an API token, you first need to change the `Username / API Key (see '?')` field to `_api_token_key`. Following this step, you can now enter the API Token into the `Password` field - this value will be used as an API key.

## Choose your API version
1. Visit the [QRadar API versions page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS42VS_SHR/com.ibm.qradarapi.doc/c_rest_api_getting_started.html) for a full list of available API versions according to the QRadar version.
2. Choose one of the API versions listed under **Supported REST API versions** column in the line corresponding to your QRadar version.

Note: If you're uncertain which API version to use, it is recommended to use the latest API version listed in the **Supported REST API versions** column in the line corresponding to your QRadar version.

### Fetch incidents
To start fetching incidents, enable the parameter `Long running instance` - this will start a long running process that'll fetch incidents periodically.
Depending on the system load, **the initial fetch might take a long time**.

#### Query to fetch offenses
You can apply additional (optional) filters for the fetch-incident query using the `Query to fetch offenses` integration parameter. For more information on how to use the filter syntax, see the [QRadar filter documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS42VS_7.3.3/com.ibm.qradar.doc/c_rest_api_filtering.html) and [QRadar offense documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS42VS_7.3.2/com.ibm.qradar.doc/11.0--siem-offenses-GET.html).
* Incident IP Enrichment - When enabled, fetched incidents IP values (local source addresses and local destination addresses) will be fetched from QRadar instead of their ID values.
* Incident Asset Enrichment - When enabled, fetched offenses will also contain correlated assets.

#### Reset the "last run" timestamp
To reset fetch incidents, run `qradar-reset-last-run` - this will reset the fetch to its initial state (will try to fetch first available offense).
