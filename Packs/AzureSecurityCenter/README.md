When migrating to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), you are responsible for securing your environment. 
This means you need to secure your network and services. 
These processes were normally handled by your cloud provider within a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) environment. 
Azure Security Center provides threat protection for data centers within both cloud workloads and on-premises. 

## What does this pack do?
- Apply security policies across your workloads.
