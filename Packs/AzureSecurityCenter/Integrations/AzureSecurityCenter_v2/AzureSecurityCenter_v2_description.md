# Authentication
### Authentication Based on Azure Active Directory Applications

Microsoft integrations (Graph and Azure) in Cortex XSOAR use Azure Active Directory applications to authenticate with Microsoft APIs. These integrations use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication services, which use an Application to sign-in or delegate authentication. For more information, see the Microsoft identity platform overview.

There are 2 application authentication methods available:

 * [Cortex XSOAR Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#cortex-xsoar-application)
 * [Self-Deployed Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#self-deployed-application)

Depending on the authentication method that you use, the integration parameters might change.

To allow us access to Azure Security Center, an administrator has to approve the Demisto app using an admin consent flow, by clicking [here](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-azure-sc).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will receive an ID, Token, and Key, which needs to be added to the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields. After giving consent, the application must have a role assigned, so it can access the relevant resources per subscription. 
For more information, see the integration documentation.

### Authentication Based on Azure Managed Identities
##### Note: This option is relevant only if the integration is running on Azure VM.
Follow one of these steps for authentication based on Azure Managed Identities:

- ##### To use System Assigned Managed Identity
   - Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox and leave the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field empty.

- ##### To use User Assigned Managed Identity
   1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) -> **Managed Identities**.
   2. Select your User Assigned Managed Identity -> copy the Client ID -> paste it in the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field in the instance settings.
   3. Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox.

For information about Azure Managed Identities see [Managed identities for Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
