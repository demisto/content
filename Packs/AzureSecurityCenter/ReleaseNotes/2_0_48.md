##### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Event Collector

- Fixed an issue where the next run timestamp could be set incorrectly when the API returned events in an unexpected order. Events are now sorted by `startTimeUtc` before determining the next run time.
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the event collection flow to improve troubleshooting capabilities.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/crypto:1.0.0.6932158*.
