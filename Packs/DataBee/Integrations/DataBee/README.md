DataBee, from Comcast Technology Solutions, is a cloud-native security and compliance data fabric that ingests data from multiple disparate feeds and then aggregates, compresses, standardizes, enriches, correlates, and normalizes the data before transferring a full time-series dataset to your data lake of choice.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of DataBee.

| --- | --- | --- |
| page | The optional size of the page to retrieve. Must be an integer greater than 0 or less than or equal to 1000. | Optional |
| page_size | The optional 0-based index of the page to retrieve. Must be an integer greater than or equal to 0. | Optional |
| limit | The maximum number of records to retrieve. Default is 50. | Optional |
| search_operator | The search operator applied to filter criteria such as the analytic name, confidence level, device environment, device risk level, impact, risk level, and severity. It accommodates list objects for filter values, enabling the specification of multiple filter values separated by commas. Specifically, when using the "In" or "Not In" operators, you can input values in formats like "High" for a single entry or "High,Low" for multiple entries. Possible values are: In, Not In. | Optional |
| analytic_name | Filter findings based on their analytic name, using one of the following operators: "In", or "Not In". The default operator is "In". You can specify a single analytic name or a list of analytic names separated by commas, such as "about" or "about, matter". | Optional |
| confidence | Filter findings based on their confidence level, using one of the following operators: "Contains", "In", or "Not In". The default operator is "Contains". Depending on the selected operator, the format for the value varies. For "Contains", a single confidence level such as "High" is acceptable. For "In" or "Not In," you can specify a single confidence level or a list of confidence levels separated by commas, such as "High" or "High,Medium". Possible values are: High, Medium, Low, Other, Unknown, Stable. | Optional |
| device_environment | Filter findings based on their device environment, using one of the following operators: "In", or "Not In". The default operator is "In". You can specify a single device environment or a list of device environments separated by commas, such as "Development" or "Development,Production". | Optional |

For "In" or "Not In," you can specify a single impact level or a list of impact levels separated by commas, such as "High" or "High,Medium". Possible values are: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Other, Unknown. | Optional |
| risk_level | Filter findings based on their risk level, using one of the following operators: "Contains", "In", or "Not In". The default operator is "Contains". Depending on the selected operator, the format for the value varies. For "Contains", a single risk level such as "High" is acceptable. For "In" or "Not In," you can specify a single risk level or a list of risk levels separated by commas, such as "High" or "High,Medium". Possible values are: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info. | Optional |
| severity | Filter findings based on their severity level, using one of the following operators: "Contains", "In", or "Not In". The default operator is "Contains". Depending on the selected operator, the format for the value varies. For "Contains", a single severity level such as "High" is acceptable.
