To access the Jizo M service, you need to:
- Be registred as operator (user role) by Security Adminstrator.
- Get user credentials (Username, Password) as parameters for the integration.

The operator connects to the JizôM Web via HTTPS. The self-signed certificates are used.
The operator can connect to the JizoM via a browser then enter the URL.

If the operator wants to access to swagger api documentation, a suffix (/api/doc) must be added to the API URL.

When the JizôM operator account is created by JizôM Web security administrator, the operator must connect to the JizôM Web at least a first time.
At the first connection, the following page « Please change your Password » is displayed to ask an user to change password.
