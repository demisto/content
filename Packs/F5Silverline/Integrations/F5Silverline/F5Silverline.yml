description: F5 Silverline Threat Intelligence is a cloud-based service incorporating
  external IP reputation and reducing threat-based communications. By identifying
  IP addresses and security categories associated with malicious activity, this managed
  service integrates dynamic lists of threatening IP addresses with the Silverline
  cloud-based platform, adding context-based security to policy decisions.
