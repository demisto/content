F5 Silverline Threat Intelligence is a cloud-based service incorporating external IP reputation and reducing threat-based communications. By identifying IP addresses and security categories associated with malicious activity, this managed service integrates dynamic lists of threatening IP addresses with the Silverline cloud-based platform, adding context-based security to policy decisions.

### f5-silverline-ip-object-add
***
Adds a new particular threatening IP address object by its IP address.


#### Base Command

`f5-silverline-ip-object-add`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| list_type | The dynamic lists type of threatening IP addresses. The type can be "allowlist" or "denylist". Note: Allowlists are named DDOS IP Allowlists in the F5 Silverline portal. Possible values are: allowlist, denylist. | Required | 
| list_target | This argument can be supplied to target either the proxy or routed denylist. If list_target is not specifiedm it will assume both proxy and routed are requested (i.e., proxy-routed). Possible values are: "proxy", "routed", or "proxy-routed". This argument limits the denylist type but is ignored for allowlist. Possible values are: proxy, routed, proxy-routed. | Optional | 
| cidr_range | The CIDR range address of a new particular threatening IP address object (i.e IP address/ mask). For example, "1.2.3.4/32". In case only IP address is given, the default mask is 32. | Required | 
| duration | The duration (in seconds) of a new particular threatening IP address object where the list type is 'denylist'. Setting the duration to 0 (default) means the new IP address object will never expire. This feature has been removed for allowlist. | Optional | 
| note | The note of a new particular threatening IP address object. Default is empty. | Optional | 
| tags | A comma-separated list of tags of a new particular threatening IP address object. | Optional | 


#### Context Output

>IP object with ID: 66202ba3-04f1-4f7c-b1a8-9a49776a96a4 deleted successfully from the denylist list.


## Fetch F5 Silverline alerts

| **F5 Silverline supported alert type** | **Incident Type** | 
| --- | --- |
| WAF logs | F5 Silverline WAF Events |
| L7 DDoS logs | F5 Silverline L7 DDoS Events |  
| Threat Intelligence logs | F5 Silverline Threat Intelligence Events |  
| iRule logs | F5 Silverline iRule Events |  


As F5 Silverline API does not support fetch incidents for now, we retrieve alerts via a log collector.   
In order to fetch alerts, follow the instructions below:
1. In Cortex XSOAR, install the F5 Silverline integration.
2. In the F5 Silverline portal, go to **Config** > **Log Export** .
3. Configure the F5 Silverline "Log Export". Follow the instructions here: https://support.f5silverline.com/hc/en-us/articles/214152048. The "Host" destination must support TLS+TCP communication. 
4. In Cortex XSOAR, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
5. Search for Syslog. (This integration is installed by  default).
6. Configure the Syslog instance with your log receiver details:
   * Click "Fetches incidents".
   * Set the Classifier to "F5 Silverline Classifier". 
   * Set the Mapper to "F5 Silverline Mapper".
   * IP address - specify the IP address of your log receiver host.
   * Port - specify the port of your log receiver host.
   * Protocol - choose TCP or UDP.
   * Format - specify to 'Auto'.

Once the log receiver is configured it will forward the logs in TCP or UDP to Cortex XSOAR - Syslog integration and you will see that incidents were successfully pulled.

* After incidents are created, you can go to the incidents page and sort them by their type.
* You can go to an incident info tab (by clicking on an incident) and see all of the incident fields (under the Case Details header).
