    - **Breaking Changes**:  Version 1 of the Alerts API has been decommissioned and replaced with Alerts v2. This move means the fields in the alerts now differ from the original fields. Additionally, Investigations no longer use the `alerts` field, but now contain `alerts2`. Any references to the Alerts v1 fields will fail.
    - Added support for viewing the assignee with the following commands:
        - ***taegisxdr-fetch-incidents***
        - ***taegisxdr-fetch-investigation***
    - Added support for searching of alerts using the CQL Taegis language.
        - ***taegis-xdr-fetch-alerts***
    - Deprecated the Alerts v1 fields and API.
    - Added support for additional unit tests.
