To allow access to Microsoft Graph Groups, an administrator has to approve the Demisto app using an admin consent flow, by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-graph-groups).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key, which needs to be added to the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.

Required Permissions in the MS Graph Groups App:
Directory.ReadWrite.All - Delegated
