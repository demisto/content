detaileddescription: "# Authentication\nYou can authenticate either by Azure Active Directory applications or by Azure Managed Identities.\n## Authentication based on Azure Active Directory applications\n\nMicrosoft integrations (Graph and Azure) in Cortex XSOAR use Azure Active Directory applications to authenticate with Microsoft APIs. These integrations use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard compliant authentication services, which use an application to sign in or delegate authentication. For more information, see the Microsoft identity platform overview.\n\nThere are two application authentication methods available:\n\n * [Cortex XSOAR Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#cortex-xsoar-application)\n * [Self-Deployed Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#self-deployed-application)\n\nDepending on the authentication method that you use, the integration parameters might change.\n\nTo allow access to Azure Active Directory Groups, an administrator has to approve the Cortex XSOAR app using an admin consent flow, by clicking this [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-graph-groups).\nAfter authorizing the Cortex XSAOR app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key which needs to be added to the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.\n\n\n## Authentication Based on Azure Managed Identities\n##### Note: This option is relevant only if the integration is running on Azure VM.\nFollow one of these steps for authentication based on Azure Managed Identities:\n\n- ##### To use System Assigned Managed Identity\n   - Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox and leave the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field empty.\n\n- ##### To use User Assigned Managed Identity\n   1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) -> **Managed Identities**.\n   2. Select your User Assigned Managed Identity -> copy the Client ID -> paste it in the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field in the instance settings.\n   3. Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox.\n\nFor more information, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).\n\n\n---\n[View Integration Documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/microsoft-graph-groups-dev)"
