comment: ' The endpoint status request enables a client application to enroll an endpoint or revoke its enrollment. This is usually relevant for endpoints with pending status but can be done for endpoints with any current status. The endpoint needs to be specified by its ID, which can have been received from an endpoints list request, from a new endpoint notification, or from any other implemented manual or automated input.'
