description: |-
  Isolates one or more CrowdStrike-managed endpoints by placing them into network containment.

  While contained, the local firewall on each host is reconfigured to block all inbound and outbound traffic,
  except for communication with CrowdStrike Cloud Services and any IP addresses explicitly allowed
  in the organization's containment policy.

  This command is useful for immediate response actions during incident investigations or active threats.
