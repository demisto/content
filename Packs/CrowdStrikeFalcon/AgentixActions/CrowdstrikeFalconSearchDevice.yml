description: >
  Searches CrowdStrike Falcon for devices (endpoints) that match the specified query criteria.
  The query can include filters such as hostname, IP address, device ID, operating system, or other attributes.
  Returns a list of matching devices based on the search parameters provided.
args:
  - name: extended_data
    underlyingargname: extended_data
    description: >
      Indicates whether to include additional device metadata in the response.
      Set to "Yes" to return extended data fields such as OS version, sensor version, and network information.

  - name: filter
    underlyingargname: filter
    description: >
      A query string to filter devices using CrowdStrike Falcon's filtering syntax.
      Format: `filter_parameter_name:'filter_value'` (e.g., `hostname:'host123'`).
      Use this to search devices by attributes such as hostname, IP, or device ID.

    description: >
      Filters devices based on the site name assigned to them in the Falcon platform.
    type: string
  - name: sort
    underlyingargname: sort
    description: >
      Sorts the results based on a device property.
      Use the format `property.direction`, such as `status.desc` (descending) or `hostname.asc` (ascending).
