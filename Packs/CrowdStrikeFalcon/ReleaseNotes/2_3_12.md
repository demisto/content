##### CrowdStrike Falcon

- **Breaking Change**: Deprecated the use_legacy parameter as of September 30th, 2025. This affects multiple detection-related commands including direct commands (cs-falcon-search-detection, cs-falcon-resolve-detection, cs-falcon-get-detections-for-incident), fetch operations for all detection types, and mirroring operations. All detection functionality will transition from legacy API endpoints to the updated Raptor API format.
