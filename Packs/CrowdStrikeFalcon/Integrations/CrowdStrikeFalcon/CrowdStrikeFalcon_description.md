### Troubleshooting
* When encountering connectivity or authorization errors within Cortex XSOAR 8, it is necessary to include the IP addresses corresponding to the relevant region in the CrowdStrike Falcon allow list. These IP addresses can be found in [this](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/8/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Enable-Access-to-Cortex-XSOAR) 
documentation, under **Egress - Used for communication between Cortex XSOAR and customer resources**.
