Jira Assets is a plugin for Jira that allows teams to track and manage their physical and digital assets within the Jira platform. It provides features such as asset tracking, inventory management, and issue tracking for assets.

## What does this pack do? 

Using the commands in the integration, you can leverage what the Jira Assets API has to offer, such as:
- Adding, reading, updating and deleting assets
- Getting object schemas
- Getting object types
- Adding, reading and deleting object's attachments
- Adding, reading and deleting object's comments

- You can perform tasks that a user would need to do manually in the Jira Assets UI or would need to provide automations to do.
