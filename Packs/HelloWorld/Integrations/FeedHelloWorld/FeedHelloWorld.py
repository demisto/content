"""HelloWorld Feed Integration for Cortex XSOAR (aka Demisto)

This feed integration is a good example on you can build a Cortex XSOAR feed
using Python 3. Please follow the documentation links below and make sure that
your feed integration follows the Code Conventions and required parameters, and passes the Linting phase.

Developer Documentation: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/welcome
Code Conventions: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/code-conventions
Feed Required Parameters: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/feeds#required-parameters
Linting: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/linting


The API
--------------

For this template, the feed used as API is OpenPhish, supplying a feed of URLs.
This API's output is of type freetext, and the suitable handling for this type can be seen in the function
'fetch_indicators'. Other APIs may have different formats, so when using this template for other feed APIs
make sure you handle the output properly according to its format.


Feed Integration File Structure
--------------------------

A feed integration usually consists of the following parts:
- Imports
- Constants
- Client Class
- Helper Functions
- Command Functions
- Main Function
- Entry Point


Imports
-------

Here you can import Python module you need for your feed integration. If you need
a module that is not part of the default XSOAR Docker images, you can add
a custom one. More details: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/docker

There are also internal imports that are used by XSOAR:
- demistomock (imported as demisto): allows your code to work offline for
testing. The actual ``demisto`` module is provided at runtime when the
code runs in XSOAR.
- CommonServerPython.py: contains a set of helper functions, base classes
and other useful components that will make your feed integration code easier
to maintain.
- CommonServerUserPython.py: includes a set of user defined commands that
are specific to an XSOAR installation. Do not use it for feed integrations that
are meant to be shared externally.

These imports are automatically loaded at runtime within the XSOAR script
runner, so you shouldn't modify them

Constants
---------

Usually some constants that do not require user parameters or inputs, such
as the default API entry point for your service, or the maximum numbers of
incidents to fetch every time.


Client Class
------------

We recommend to use a Client class to wrap all the code that needs to interact
with your API. Moreover, we recommend, when possible, to inherit from the
BaseClient class, defined in CommonServerPython.py. This class already handles
a lot of the work, such as system proxy settings, SSL certificate verification
and exception handling for HTTP errors.

Note that the Client class should NOT contain any Cortex XSOAR specific code,
i.e. it shouldn't use anything in the ``demisto`` class (functions such as
``demisto.args()`` or ``demisto.results()`` or even ``return_results`` and
``return_error``.
You will use the Command Functions to handle XSOAR inputs and outputs.

When calling an API, you should use the ``_http.request()`` method and you
can return the raw data to the calling function (usually a Command function).

You should usually have one function for each API endpoint.

Look at the code and the commands of this specific class to better understand
the implementation details.


Helper Functions
----------------

Helper functions are usually used as utility functions that are used by several
command functions throughout your code. For example they map arguments to types
or convert severity formats from feed integration-specific to XSOAR.
Many helper functions are already defined in ``CommonServerPython.py`` and are
often very handy.


Command Functions
-----------------

Command functions perform the mapping between XSOAR inputs and outputs to the
Client class functions inputs and outputs. As a best practice, they shouldn't
contain calls to ``demisto.args()``, ``demisto.results()``, ``return_error``
and ``demisto.command()`` as those should be handled through the ``main()``
function.
However, in command functions, use ``demisto`` or ``CommonServerPython.py``
artifacts, such as ``demisto.debug()`` or the ``CommandResults`` class and the
``Common.*`` classes.

Every feed integration should have these three base commands:
``<product-prefix>-get-indicators`` - where <product-prefix> is replaced by the name
of the Product or Vendor source providing the feed. So for example, if you were
developing a feed integration for Microsoft Intune this command might be called
msintune-get-indicators. This command should fetch a limited number of indicators
from the feed source and display them in the war room.
``fetch-indicators`` - this command will initiate a request to the feed endpoint, format
the data fetched from the endpoint to conform to Cortex XSOAR's expected input format
and create new indicators. If the integration instance is configured to Fetch indicators,
then this is the command that will be executed at the specified Feed Fetch Interval.
``test-module`` - this is the command that is run when the Test button in the configuration
 panel of a feed integration is clicked.

Main Function
-------------

The ``main()`` function takes care of reading the feed integration parameters via
the ``demisto.params()`` function, initializes the Client class and checks the
different options provided to ``demisto.commands()``, to invoke the correct
command function passing to it ``demisto.args()`` and returning the data to
``return_results()``. ``main()`` also catches exceptions and
returns an error message via ``return_error()``.


Entry Point
-----------

This is the integration code entry point. It checks whether the ``__name__``
variable is ``__main__`` , ``__builtin__`` (for Python 2) or ``builtins`` (for
Python 3) and then calls the ``main()`` function. Just keep this convention.
