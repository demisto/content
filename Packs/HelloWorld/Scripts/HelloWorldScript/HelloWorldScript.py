"""HelloWorld Script for Cortex XSOAR (aka Demisto)

This script is just a simple example on Code Convetions to write automation
scripts in Cortex XSOAR using Python 3.
Please follow the documentation links below and make sure that
your integration follows the Code Conventions and passes the Linting phase.

Developer Documentation: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/welcome
Code Conventions: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/code-conventions
Linting: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/linting

Usually we recommend to separate the code that interacts with XSOAR specific
functions and keep in the ``main()`` and in the Command functions, while the
actual code that does what you need will stay in a standalone function or
class.

For a more complete example on how to build Integrations, please check the
HelloWorld Integration code.
