### fortigate-move-firewall-policy

***
Move the position of firewall policies. Firewall policies dictate the traffic flow and its processing. They are integral to most of the firewall functions, ensuring that every piece of traffic passing through the unit adheres to a specific policy. These policies determine the direction of the traffic, processing method, and its permission to traverse the firewall.

#### Base Command

`fortigate-move-firewall-policy`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| policyID | ID of the policy to move. IDs can be retrieved with the command `fortigate-list-firewall-policies`. | Required |
| vdom | Virtual domains (VDOMs) enable you to partition and use your FortiGate unit as if it were multiple units. Use `*` to retrieve all virtual domains. VDOMs can be retrieved with the command `fortigate-list-system-vdoms`. Default is root. | Optional |
| position | Whether to position the policy before or after its neighbor. Possible values are: before, after. | Required |
| neighbor | The ID of the neighbor policy. IDs can be retrieved with the command `fortigate-list-firewall-policies`. | Required |

#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fortigate.Policy.ID | Number | The policy ID. |
| Fortigate.Policy.Moved | Boolean | Whether the policy was moved. |

#### Command example
```!fortigate-move-firewall-policy policyID=123456789 position=after neighbor=1010101```
#### Context Example
```json
{
    "Fortigate": {
        "Policy": {
            "ID": "123456789",
            "Moved": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### Human Readable Output

>## The firewall policy '123456789' was successfully moved.

### fortigate-delete-firewall-policy

***
Delete firewall policies. Firewall policies dictate the traffic flow and its processing. They are integral to most of the firewall functions, ensuring that every piece of traffic passing through the unit adheres to a specific policy. These policies determine the direction of the traffic, processing method, and its permission to traverse the firewall.

#### Base Command

`fortigate-delete-firewall-policy`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| policyID | ID of the policy to delete. IDs can be retrieved with the command `fortigate-list-firewall-policies`. | Required |
| vdom | Virtual domains (VDOMs) enable you to partition and use your FortiGate unit as if it were multiple units. Use `*` to retrieve all virtual domains. VDOMs can be retrieved with the command `fortigate-list-system-vdoms`. Default is root. | Optional |

#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fortigate.Policy.ID | Number | The policy ID. |
| Fortigate.Policy.Deleted | Boolean | Whether the policy was deleted. |

#### Command example
```!fortigate-delete-firewall-policy policyID=123456789```
#### Context Example
```json
{
    "Fortigate": {
        "Policy": {
            "Deleted": true,
            "ID": "123456789"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Human Readable Output

### fortigate-list-system-vdoms

***
Retrieve system VDOMs. Virtual Domains (VDOMs) are used to divide a FortiGate into two or more virtual units that function independently. VDOMs can provide separate security policies and, in NAT mode, completely separate configurations for routing and VPN services for each connected network. Multiple VDOMs can be created and managed as independent units in multi VDOM mode.

#### Base Command

`fortigate-list-system-vdoms`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filter_field | Specifies the field to be searched, such as `name` or `comment`, to narrow down the search criteria within the objects. Fields must be written as they are in the `raw_response`. Reference to possible fields: `https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.5/cli-reference/620/config-system-vdom`. | Optional |
| filter_value | Indicates the value or partial value, for example `Sales`, that the API should look for within the specified field to find matching objects. | Optional |
| format_fields | Comma-separated fields to format the API call to display certain information. Fields must be written as they are in the `raw_response`, for example: `name` or `comment`. Reference to possible fields: `https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.5/cli-reference/620/config-system-vdom`. | Optional |

#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fortigate.VDOM.VClusterID | Number | Virtual cluster ID. |
| Fortigate.VDOM.ShortName | String | The virtual domain short name. |
| Fortigate.VDOM.Name | String | The virtual domain name. |

#### Command example
```!fortigate-list-system-vdoms```
#### Context Example
```json
{
    "Fortigate": {
        "VDOM": {
            "Name": "root",
            "ShortName": "root",
