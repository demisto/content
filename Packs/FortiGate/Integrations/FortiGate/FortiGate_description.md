## How to Achieve Authentication
To authenticate with FortiGate, you can use one of two methods:
- **Username/Password Authentication**: Use the same `Account username` and `Password` that you would use to log into FortiGate itself.
- **API Key Authentication**: Generate an `API key` through **System** -> **Administrators** -> **REST API Administrator** -> **Regenerate**.

After choosing an authentication method, click **Test** to validate the connection.

Note: You must provide at least one of these authentication methods (username/password or API key), but not both simultaneously.
