- Updated the mapping for `xdm.network.application_protocol_category` and `xdm.network.application_protocol_category` replacing mapped "*unknown*" string values with *null*. 
- Updated the mapping for `xdm.source.interface` and `xdm.target.interface` to be populated from the source and target MAC addresses (respectively), rather than their physical port interfaces.
