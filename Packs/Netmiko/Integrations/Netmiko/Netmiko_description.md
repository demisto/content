## Netmiko SSH module integration

This integration provides ssh-based access to network devices, servers, and other appliances that support this method of configuration. For a complete list of supported platforms, visit the following URL:

[Netmiko Platforms.md on Github](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/PLATFORMS.md)

## Configuration Parameters

 - *Name* - Integration instance name.
 - *Platform* - The Netmiko-specific platform name.
 - *Hostname* - The IP address, hostname, or FQDN to connect to over SSH.
 - *Port* - The port to use for the SSH connection.
 - *Credentials* - The credentials should be the same as the Tanium client.

**NOTE**: Platform names are taken from the supported
[SSH](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/PLATFORMS.md#supported-ssh-device_type-values) or [Telnet](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/PLATFORMS.md#supported-telnet-device_type-values) device type lists on GitHub.
  
### SSH Keys

To provide SSH Keys for a login, and for security purposes, this can only be done by using the **credentials** store under *Integrations->Credentials* and placing the private key in the *Certificate* section. This requires from the **-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----** (or equivalent key type) to the **-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----** (or equivalent key type).

When you **DO** provide SSH keys in the credentials, the password becomes the password for the SSH key.
