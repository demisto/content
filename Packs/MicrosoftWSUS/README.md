## Collect Events from Vendor
In order to use the collector, you need to use the following option to collect events from the vendor:
- [XDRC (XDR Collector)](#xdrc-xdr-collector)
You will need to configure the vendor and product for this specific collector.

* Pay attention: Timestamp parsing is supported in UTC (+0000) timezone for the **yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.3ms UTC** format.

### XDRC (XDR Collector)

You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/cortex-xdr-collectors/xdr-collector-datasets#id7f0fcd4d-b019-4959-a43a-40b03db8a8b2).

You can configure the vendor and product by replacing [vendor]_[product]raw with msft_wsus_raw. 

When configuring the instance, you should use a YAML file that configures the vendor and product, as seen in the configuration below for the Microsoft WSUS product.
