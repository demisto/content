This Content Pack facilitates retrieval of High Risk Entities identified by GRA by creating a case for each entity within GRA.
These high risk entities are fetched in XSOAR and a corresponding incident is created for each entity in XSOAR.
As a part of this integration, workflows can be configured at XSOAR based on different commands provided by GRA. These will define the actions to be taken on a particular high risk entity based on the Risk Score.
