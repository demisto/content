Alexa provides website ranking information that can be used to help determine if a domain has a strong web presence.
This integration was integrated and tested with Alexa Rank Indicator V2.

##### New: Alexa Rank Indicator v2
- Use of the Alexa API rank.
- Domains that are not in the Alexa database, are considered "Unknown" instead of "Suspicious".
- If the domain doesn't exist, there is an error.
- Default values changed: 1000 for *Top Domain Threshold* and unspecified for *Suspicous Domain Threshold*.

## Configure Alexa Rank Indicator V2 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Alexa Rank Indicator V2.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | True |
    | Rank threshold for suspicious domain | If the domain's Alexa rank is over this threshold, the domain is marked as suspicious. If the rank is between the threshold for suspicious domains and top domains, the domain is marked as *unknown*. | True |
    | Base API URL |  | True |
    | Rank threshold for top domains | If the domain's Alexa rank is under this threshold, the domain is considered trusted and marked as good. If the rank is between the threshold for suspicious domains and top domains, the domain is marked as *unknown*. | True |
