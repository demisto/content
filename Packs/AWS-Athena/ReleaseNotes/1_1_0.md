#### Integrations

##### AWS - Athena

- The integration is no longer in beta.
- Added the **Timeout** and **Retries** instance configuration options.
- Added an `query_execution_id` to the ***aws-athena-query-results*** command results, to help differentiate between results from different queries.
- Updated the context output keys of commands to be separated from each other (previously, the keys were nested under the same `Query` key).
- Updated the output of the ***aws-athena-query-results*** command to parsed & arranged results instead of the previous raw response.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/boto3py3:1.0.0.80248*.
