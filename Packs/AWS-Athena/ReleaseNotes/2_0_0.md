#### Integrations

##### AWS - Athena

- The integration is no longer in beta.
- Added a new **aws-athena-execute-query** command, which will execute a new query, wait using polling until the query is completed, and return query execution information and the results.
- Added the **Timeout** and **Retries** instance configuration options.
- Added a **QueryLimit** parameter to the ***aws-athena-start-query** command.
- Added a `query_execution_id` key to the ***aws-athena-query-results*** command's context results, to help differentiate between results from different queries.
- Updated the context output keys of commands to be unique and separate for each command (previously, the context output for all commands was under the same `Query` key).
- Updated the output of the ***aws-athena-query-results*** command to parsed & arranged results instead of the previous raw response.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/boto3py3:1.0.0.83094*.
