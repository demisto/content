Bastille provides customers the ability to discover, locate, and mitigate radio frequency (RF)
threats to their assets, facilities and networks. These threats arise from managed, unmanaged and
rogue wireless, IoT and Cellular devices. Bastille does this protection by using Software Defined
Radios (SDRs) to passively observe the entire radio space in a facility and report the existence,
position, and network connectivity of RF devices that are present.
