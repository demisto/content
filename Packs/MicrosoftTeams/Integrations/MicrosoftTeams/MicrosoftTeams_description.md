Use the Microsoft Teams integration to send messages and notifications to your team members and create meetings. 

To create an instance of the Microsoft Teams integration in Cortex XSOAR, complete the following:

1. Create the Demisto Bot in Microsoft Teams
2. Grant the Demisto Bot Permissions in Microsoft Graph
3. Configure Microsoft Teams on Demisto
4. Add the Demisto Bot to a Team
 
Important note: resetting the integration cache removes all data about teams, channels, members saved in the integration context. Performing this step requires removing the bot from all teams it was added to.

For more information about registering a calling bot see the [Microsoft Teams Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/calls-and-meetings/registering-calling-bot#add-microsoft-graph-permissions).
