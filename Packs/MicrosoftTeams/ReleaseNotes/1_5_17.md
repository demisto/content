#### Integrations

##### Microsoft Teams

Added support for the ***send-notification-quick-action*** command that sends a message to the specified teams.
to mention a user in the message, add a semicolon ";" at the end of the user mention. for example: @bruce willis;.

if sending a reply to a message, the message id must be provided and the reply will be sent via the graph api which means
the message will appear from the account used to authorize the integration instance and not the bot. setting the account's name
and picture to match the bot will make it appear to be from the same source.
