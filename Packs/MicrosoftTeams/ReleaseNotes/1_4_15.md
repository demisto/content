#### Integrations

##### Microsoft Teams
- Fixed an issue where the BOT ID was not sent correctly when running the ***microsoft-teams-chat-create*** and ***microsoft-teams-message-send-to-chat*** commands.

- Added the message metadata to incidents created using Demisto BOT in Microsoft Teams. You can now map these values using a custom mapper.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/teams:1.0.0.55061*.
