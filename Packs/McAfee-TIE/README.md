Use the McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) integration to get file reputations and the systems that reference the files.

## What does this content pack do?
- Retrieves threat intelligence data about files from global, and local sources.
- Determine which and when local systems have executed files.
- Manages threat intelligence data locally, giving the user the opportunity to set specific data about files.

## Authentication
1. McAfee Threat Intelligence uses the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL) to be able to connect and retrieve data from multiple products and endpoints.
2. The connection is done by creating certificates and configuring them in the ePO (McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator) server.
