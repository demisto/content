Use the McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) integration to get file reputations and the systems that reference the files.
Connect to McAfee TIE using the McAfee DXL client.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 2.0 of McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange V2

Some changes have been made that might affect your existing content. 
If you are upgrading from a previous version of this integration, see [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes).


## Detailed Instructions
This section includes information required for configuring an integration instance.
### Prerequisites - Connect to McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) using the DXL TIE Client
To connect the McAfee TIE using the DXL TIE client, you need to create certificates and configure DXL. For more information, see the [documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/mc-afee-dxl#how-to-create-the-rsa-key-pair). After you complete this configuration, you will have the following files:
1. Broker CA certificates (`brokercerts.crt` file)
2. Client certificate (`client.crt` file)
3. Client private key (`client.key` file)
4. Broker list properties file (`brokerlist.properties` file)

**Important**: These are the actual certificates, not request certificates.

### set-file instruction
To use the ***tie-set-file-reputation*** command, you need to authorize the client (Cortex XSOAR) to run the command. Follow the [instructions](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/marsendauth.html) to do so. In step 4, instead of selecting **Active Response Server API**, select **TIE Server Set Enterprise Reputation**.

### Dependencies (Python packages)
You don't need to install the packages, they are included in the Docker image.
  - DXL Client [documentation](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.client.html)
  - DXL TIE Client [documentation](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-tie-client-python/pydoc/dxltieclient.client.html)

## Configure McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange V2 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange V2.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Broker CA certificates | From \`brokercerts.crt\` file. | True |
    | Client certificates | From \`client.crt\` file. | True |
    | Client private key | From \`client.key\` file. Make sure that the type of the field is not \`encrypted\` when filling it out. | True |
    | Broker URLs | The format should be: `[ssl://]<hostname>[:port]`. Get the hostname and port from the \`brokerlist.properties\` file. The broker should be reachable from Cortex XSOAR server. | True |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
