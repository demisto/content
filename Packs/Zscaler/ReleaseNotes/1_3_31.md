#### Integrations

##### Zscaler Internet Access

- Improved the **zscaler-category-add-url** command documentation to explain how to correctly input URLs that contain commas. When a URL includes a comma, the `url` argument must be passed as a JSON array wrapped in backticks. Added examples for both single and multiple URLs with commas.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.8.1983910*.
