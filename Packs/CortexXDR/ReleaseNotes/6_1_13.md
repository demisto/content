#### Integrations

##### Cortex XDR - IOC

- Temporarily disabled the `iocs_to_keep` functionality due to an issue in the XDR API.
- Added the `zip` argument to **xdr-iocs-create-sync-file**, to return a zipped file.
- Added the `set_time` argument to **xdr-iocs-create-sync-file**, saving the command run timestamp, effecting future indicator synchronizations by the integration (indicators modified before this time will be ignored).
- Added logs
- Updated the docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.87159*.
