#### Incident Types
- **XDR Device Control Violations**

#### Indicator Fields
- **XDR device control violations**

#### Layouts
- **Cortex XDR Device Control Violations**

#### Playbooks

##### New: Cortex XDR device control violations
- Queries Cortex XDR for device control violations for the specified hosts, IP address, or XDR endpoint id. It then communicates via email with the involved users to understand the nature of the incident and if the user connected the device. 
All the collected data will be displayed in the XDR device control incident layout.
This playbook can also be associated with Cortex XDR device control violation job to periodically query and investigate XDR device control violations; in this configuration, the playbook will only communicate with the involved users. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0).
##### New: JOB - Cortex XDR query endpoint device control violations
- A Job to periodically query Cortex XDR device control violations by a given timestamp in a relative date playbook input.
The Collected data, if found will be generated for a new incident.
You can set the created new incident type in the playbook input, use XDR Device Control Violations incident type to associate it with the response playbook.
The job includes an incident type with a dedicated layout to visualize the collected data.
To set the job correctly, you will need to.

1. Create a new recurring job.
2. Set the recurring schedule.
3. Add a name.
4. Set type to XDR Device Control Violations.
5. Set this playbook as the job playbook.

The scheduled run time and the timestamp relative date should be identical.
If the job is recurring every 7 days, the timestamp should be 7 days as well. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0).
