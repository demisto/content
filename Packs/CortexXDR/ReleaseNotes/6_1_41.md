##### Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response

- Fixed an issue where updating the incident status in XDR when mirrored to XSOAR would result in a "resolved_other" status if resolved.
- Fixed an issue where duplicate incident statuses would not change the alert status. (?)
- Updated the Docker image to: demisto/python3:3.10.14.92207.
