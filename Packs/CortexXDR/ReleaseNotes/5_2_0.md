##### New: Remote PsExec with LOLBIN command execution alert

- New: The "Remote PsExec-like LOLBIN Command Execution" playbook is designed to address and respond to alerts indicating suspicious activities related to remote PsExec-like LOLBIN command execution from an unsigned non-standard source. 
The playbook aims to efficiently:

- Get the alert data and check if the execution is blocked. If not will terminate the process (manually by default).
- Enrich any entities and indicators from the alert and find any related campaigns.
- Perform command analysis to provide insights and a verdict for the executed command.
- Perform further endpoint investigation using Cortex XDR.
- Checks for any malicious verdicts found to raise the severity of the alert.
- Perform automatic/manual remediation response by blocking any malicious indicators found.

The playbook is designed to run as a sub-playbook in ‘Cortex XDR Incident Handling - v3 & Cortex XDR Alerts Handling’.
It depends on the data from the parent playbooks and cannot be used as a standalone version.
