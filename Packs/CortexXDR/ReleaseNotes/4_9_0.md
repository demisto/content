#### Integrations
##### Cortex XDR - IOC
- Added the `Severity Field` parameter, allowing to configure a field (default=`sourceoriginalseverity`) to use as the severity of the indicator.
- Fixed an issue in the **xdr-iocs-push** command where the *indicators* argument could not be passed as a list from the context.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.8.36650*.
