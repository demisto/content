#### Integrations

##### Cortex XDR - IOC

- Fixed an issue where **fetch-indicators** failed to sync large amount of indicators after instance setup or reset. As part of this fix, the initial sync to Cortex XDR is now incremental, in batches of 40,000, based on modification time
- Updated the **fetch-indicators** sync order changes: in order to treat Cortex XSOAR as the main source, first sending changes from Cortex XSOAR to Cortex XDR and then from Cortex XDR to Cortex XSOAR.
