##### Cortex XDR - Large Upload

- Fixed an issue where incorrect object was configured for the *'Found Results?'* conditional task.
- Added additional regex expressions to the *'Check Uploaded Data Volume'* task in order to remove decimal points from the amount of uploaded data before it is compared with the *'Transferred_Data _Threshold'* playbook input.
