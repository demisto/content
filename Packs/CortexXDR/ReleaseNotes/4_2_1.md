 This is a beta playbook, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. At the moment we support AWS but are working towards multi-cloud support. Since the playbook is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the playbook during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the content to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.
