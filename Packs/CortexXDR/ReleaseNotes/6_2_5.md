#### Integrations

##### Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response

- **Breaking Changes**: Set **Remove legacy incident fields** to default true. This means that the incident data before going through the mapper is in the following format word1_word2 (and not word1word2) for example: alert_id and not alertid, and that in the context data keys in alerts, file_artifacts and network_artifacts will appear in the word1_word2 format if originated from the API request.**Important None:** Soon we will no longer support this parameter, meaning we will remove all fields of format word1word2 (e.g., alertid) from the alerts, **Make sure to check and update the custom content in order to work with the word1_word2 (eg. alert_id) only.**
- **Breaking Changes**: Deleted the *Minimize Incident Information* parameter. All incidents pulled to Cortex XSOAR will include the file artifacts and networks artifacts.
- **Breaking Changes**: Deleted the *Minimize Incident Information* parameter. All incidents pulled to Cortex XSOAR will include the file artifacts and networks artifacts.
- **Breaking Changes**: Added the *Minimize Alert Information* parameter. Default value: null_values. This parameter will filter out the specified fields from the Cortex XDR alerts. If null_values is specified, will remove all empty values from the alerts data.
- **Breaking Changes**: Added the *Minimize Alert Information* parameter. Default value: null_values. This parameter will filter out the specified fields from the Cortex XDR alerts. If null_values is specified, will remove all empty values from the alerts data.
- **Breaking Changes**: Added the *Remove Additional Data* parameter. Default value: True. This parameter will remove the Additional Data field (additionaldata in the context data) in cases which the incident type is XDR incident Lite or Malware Investigation and Response. **Important None:** Soon we will no longer support this parameter, meaning we will remove the Additional Data field (additionaldata in the context data) from the relevant incidents.
