#### Playbooks
##### New: **Cortex XDR - Endpoint Investigation**
This playbook handles all the endpoint investigation actions available with Cortex XSIAM, including:
* Pre-defined MITRE Tactics
* Host fields (host ID)
* Attacker fields (attacker IP, external host)
* MITRE techniques
* File hash (currently, the playbook supports only SHA256)  
**Note:**  
The playbook inputs enable manipulating the execution flow; read the input descriptions for details. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
##### New: **Cortex XDR Malware - Incident Enrichment**
This playbook enriches the Cortex XDR incident. The enrichment is done on the involved endpoint and Mitre technique ID information, and sets the 'Malware-Investigation and Response' layout. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).

- Cortex XDR insights
- Command Line Analysis 
- Dedup
- Sandbox hash search and detonation
- Cortex XDR enrichment
- Incident handling (true/false positive) (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
##### New: **Cortex XDR - True Positive Incident Handling**
This playbook handles true-positive incident closure for Cortex XDR - Malware Investigation. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
