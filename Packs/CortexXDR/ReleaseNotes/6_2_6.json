    "breakingChangesNotes": "- Set *Remove legacy incident fields* parameter to default true. This means that the incident data fields of Alerts, File Artifacts and Network Artifacts are in the following format: word1_word2 (and not word1word2) for example: alert_id and not alertid. **Important None:** Soon we will no longer support this parameter, meaning we will remove all fields of format word1word2 (e.g., alertid) from the Alerts, File Artifacts and Network Artifacts **Make sure to check and update the custom content in order to work with the word1_word2 (eg. alert_id) only.**\n- Deleted the *Minimize Incident Information* parameter. All incidents pulled to Cortex XSOAR will include the File Artifacts and Networks Artifacts.\n- Added the *Minimize Alert Information* parameter. Default value: null_values. This parameter will filter out the specified fields from the Cortex XDR alerts. If null_values is specified, will remove all None values from the alerts data.\n- Added the *Remove Additional Data* parameter. Default value: True. This parameter will remove the Additional Data field (can be seen under incident.additionaldata in the context data) in cases which the incident type is XDR incident Lite or Malware Investigation and Response. **Important None:** Soon we will no longer support this parameter, meaning we will remove the incident.additionaldata field so we highly recommend going over the custom content and make sure to adjust it to not using incident.additionaldata, can use incident.xdralerts instead."
