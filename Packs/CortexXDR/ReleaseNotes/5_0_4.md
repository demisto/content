##### Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response

- Fixed an issue where the integration failed when searching for a value that doesn't exist, when running one of the following commands:
    - ***xdr-list-risky-users***
    - ***xdr-list-risky-hosts***
    - ***xdr-list-user-groups***
    - ***xdr-list-roles***
