##### Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response

- Fixed an issue in *mirroring* where incident updates from Cortex XDR were not reflected due to recent changes in the Cortex XDR platform. This was addressed by adding the *xdr delay in minutes* argument to extend the look-back period.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.9.107902*.
