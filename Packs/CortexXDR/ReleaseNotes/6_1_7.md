##### New: Cortex XDR IOCs - Disable expired IOCs in XDR

- New: This is a *sub-playbook* of "Cortex XDR IOCs - Push new IOCs to XDR (Main)". This playbook disables indicators in Cortex XDR after they expire from Cortex XSOAR using a loop and querying on the "xdr_pushed" tag.

##### New: Cortex XDR IOCs - Push new IOCs to XDR

- New: This is a *sub-playbook* of "Cortex XDR IOCs - Push new IOCs to XDR - Main" and should not be run on its own. This sub-playbook will retrieve IOCs according to the users query input (passed from the main playbook) and push them into XDR, and mark them as "xdr_pushed" or "xdr_not_processed" for further processing.

##### New: Cortex XDR IOCs - Push new IOCs to XDR (Main)

- New: This is the *main* playbook for XDR IOCs sync. The playbook will "sync" IOCs into XDR by pushing new IOCs in and disabling expired IOCs. The playbook utilizes XSOAR tags and loops in order to find IOCs using a query provided by the user. The play book will iterate over the IOCs pushing them in batches into XDR. In the second phase the playbook will disable expired  IOCs that were previously pushed into XDR. We recommend running this playbook as a Job a few times a day after disabling the integration sync function.
