- This playbook creating an array called "Suspicious Elements", which is used to count potential security threats. The following elements can be added to the array:

"IP Reputation": This element will be added if the IP reputation is deemed suspicious or malicious.
"Related Campaign": This element will be added if an RDP brute force attack from an external IP is found to be related to a specific campaign, as determined by threat intelligence management (TIM).
"Hunting Results": This element will be added if the results of "Threat Hunting - Generic" are returned.
"Related Alerts": This element will be added if any additional alerts related to the attacked user and hostname are found.
"Unusual Country": This element will be added if the RDP connection originates from an unusual country.

The array will then be outputted and its size will be compared to a final threshold. If the size is greater than or equal to the threshold, the investigation's final verdict will be deemed a "True Positive." (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
