##### New: Cortex XDR Alerts Handling v2

The new playbook does not get extra incident data for each alert, and does not declare any outputs. Using this playbook retains backward-compatibility while significantly reducing the size of the workplan state in the system and improving performance.

##### Cortex XDR incident handling v3

- Fixed an issue where the playbook was using Cortex XDR - Alerts Handling with global context enabled while still outputting outputs. The new playbook now has no outputs but is still executed with global context, significantly reducing the size of workplan state in the system.
- Updated the playbook to use Cortex XDR - Alerts Handling v2.
