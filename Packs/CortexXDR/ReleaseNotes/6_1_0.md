#### Playbooks

##### New: Cortex XDR Alerts Handling v2

The new playbook does not get extra incident data for each alert, and does not declare any outputs. Alert extra data is instead retrieved in the Incident Handling v3 playbook. Using this playbook retains backward-compatibility while significantly reducing the size of the workplan state in the system and improving performance.

##### Cortex XDR Alerts Handling

Deprecated. Use Cortex XDR - Alerts Handling v2 instead. When using the v2 version, enabling globally shared context for that playbook is required because outputs are no longer declared.

##### Cortex XDR incident handling v3

- Fixed an issue where the playbook was using Cortex XDR - Alerts Handling with global context enabled while still outputting outputs. The new playbook now has no outputs but is still executed with global context, significantly reducing the size of workplan state in the system.
- Updated the playbook to use Cortex XDR - Alerts Handling v2.
