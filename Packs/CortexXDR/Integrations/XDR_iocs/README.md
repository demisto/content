Cortex XDR is the world's first detection and response app that natively integrates network, endpoint and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks.

Use the Cortex XDR - IOCs feed integration to sync indicators between Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR. The integration will sync indicators according to the defined fetch interval. At each interval, the integration will push new and modified indicators defined in the **Sync Query** from Cortex XSOAR to Cortex XDR. Additionally, the integration will check if there are manual modifications of indicators on Cortex XDR and sync back to Cortex XSOAR. Once per day, the integration will perform a *complete sync* which will also remove indicators that have been deleted/expired in Cortex XSOAR, from Cortex XDR. 


This integration was integrated and tested with Branch: stable-50 of XDR.

## Prerequisites

An API key of type **Advanced** with an **Administrator** role.

## Commands  
You can execute these commands from the CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.  
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.  
### xdr-iocs-sync  
***
Sync IOCs with Cortex XDR.
Run this command manually only when configuring the instance integration with fetch indicators disabled (run this only once).
It is not recommended to run this manually when there are more then 40,000 indicators.

When `fetch indicators` is enabled, the sync mechanism is used by default. This sets the current time as the last sync time and fetches IOCs from Cortex XSOAR to Cortex XDR, sorted by modification time, in batches of 40,000, up to that time. Upon reaching the last sync point, the synchronization becomes bi-directional, first from Cortex XSOAR to Cortex XDR, then from Cortex XDR to Cortex XSOAR.

As a result, the duration of the first sync depends on the number of IOCs in the Cortex XSOAR tenant and the Feed Fetch Interval. For example, if there are 800,000 indicators in Cortex XSOAR and the `Feed Fetch Interval` is set to 20 minutes as recommended, the initial sync process will take approximately 7 hours.
