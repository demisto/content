Cortex XDR is the world's first detection and response app that natively integrates network, endpoint, and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 2.6.5 of Cortex XDR - IR

## Configure Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Fetch incidents |  | False |
    | Incident type |  | False |
    | Incident Mirroring Direction |  | False |
    | Server URL (copy URL from XDR - click ? to see more info.) |  | True |
    | API Key ID |  | False |
    | API Key |  | False |
    | HTTP Timeout | The timeout of the HTTP requests sent to Cortex XDR API \(in seconds\). | False |
    | Maximum number of incidents per fetch | The maximum number of incidents per fetch. Cannot exceed 100. | False |
    | Only fetch starred incidents |  | False |
    | Starred incidents fetch window | Starred fetch window timestamp \(&amp;lt;number&amp;gt; &amp;lt;time unit&amp;gt;, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days\). Fetches only starred incidents within the specified time range. | False |
    | First fetch timestamp (&lt;number&gt; &lt;time unit&gt;, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days) |  | False |
    | Sync Incident Owners | For Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0 and above. If selected, for every incident fetched from Cortex XDR to Cortex XSOAR, the incident owners will be synced. Note that once this value is changed and synchronized between the systems, additional changes will not be reflected. For example, if you change the owner in Cortex XSOAR, the new owner will also be changed in Cortex XDR. However, if you now change the owner back in Cortex XDR, this additional change will not be reflected in Cortex XSOAR. In addition, for this change to be reflected, the owners must exist in both Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR. | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Prevent Only Mode | Whether the XDR tenant Mode is prevent only | False |
    | Incident Statuses to Fetch | The statuses of the incidents that will be fetched. If no status is provided then incidents of all the statuses will be fetched. Note: An incident whose status was changed to a filtered status after its creation time will not be fetched. | False |
    | Incidents Fetch Interval |  | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Configuration
---
You need to collect several pieces of information in order to configure the integration on Cortex XSOAR.

#### Generate an API Key and API Key ID
1. In your Cortex XDR platform, go to **Settings**.
2. Click the **+New Key** button in the top right corner.
3. Generate a key of type **Advanced**.
4. Copy and paste the key.
5. From the ID column, copy the Key ID.

*Note*: When Configuring a role for the API Key's permission you can create a custom role or use a builtin.
The highest privileged builtin role is the Instance Admin. 
For builtin role with less permission but maximum command running abilities, use the `Privileged Responder`.  

#### URL
1. In your Cortex XDR platform, go to **Settings** > **Configurations** > **API key** page > **API Keys**.
2. Click the **Copy URL** button in the top right corner.

## Playbooks
---
#### Cortex XDR Incident Handling
The playbook syncs and updates new XDR alerts that construct the incident.
It enriches indicators using Threat Intelligence integrations and Palo Alto Networks
AutoFocus. The incident's severity is then updated based on the indicators reputation
and an analyst is assigned for manual investigation. If chosen, automated remediation
with Palo Alto Networks FireWall is initiated. After a manual review by the
SOC analyst, the XDR incident is closed automatically.


## Use Cases
---
- Fetch incidents from XDR
- Enrich incident with alerts and incident from XDR
- Update incident in XDR
- Search for endpoints
- Isolate/unisolate endpoints
- Insert parsed alerts into XDR
- Insert CEF alerts into XDR
- Query for agent audit reports
- Query for audit management logs
- Create distribution
- Get distribution download URL
- Get distribution versions

## Automation
---
To sync incidents between Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR, you should use the **XDRSyncScript** script, which you can find in the automation page.

## Fetched Incidents Data

## XDR Incident Mirroring
**Note this feature is available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0**

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Cortex XDR incidents.
To setup the mirroring follow these instructions:
1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for Cortex XDR - IR and select your integration instance.
3. Enable **Fetches incidents**.
4. Under **Mapper (incoming)**, select `XDR - Incoming Mapper`.
5. Under **Mapper (outgoing)**, select `Cortex XDR - Outgoing Mapper`.
6. In the *Incident Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:
  * Incoming - Any changes in XDR incidents will be reflected in XSOAR incidents.
  * Outgoing - Any changes in XSOAR incidents will be reflected in XDR incidents.
  * Both - Changes in XSOAR and XDR incidents will be reflected in both directions.
  * None - Choose this to turn off incident mirroring.
7. Optional: Check the *Sync Incident Owners* integration parameter to sync the incident owners in both XDR and XSOAR.
  * Note: This feature will only work if the same users are registered in both Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR.
8. Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction.
  * Note: This will not effect existing incidents.

### XDR Mirroring Notes, limitations and Troubleshooting

* While you can mirror changes in incident fields both in and out in each incident, you can only mirror in a single direction at a time. For example:
  If we have an incident with two fields (A and B) in XDR and XSOAR while *Incoming And Outgoing* mirroring is selected: 
   * I can mirror field A from XDR to XSOAR and field B from XSOAR to XDR.
   * I cannot mirror changes from field A in both directions.

  Initially all fields are mirrored in from XDR to XSOAR. Once they are changed in XSOAR, they can only be mirrored out.
* **Do not use the `XDRSyncScript` automation nor any playbook that uses this automation** 
  (e.g `Cortex XDR Incident Sync` or `Cortex XDR incident handling v2`), as it impairs the mirroring functionality.

* When migrating an existing instance to the mirroring feature, or in case the mirroring does not work as expected, make sure that:
   * The default playbook of the *Cortex XDR Incident* incident type is not *Cortex XDR Incident Sync*, change it to a 
     different playbook that does not use `XDRSyncScript`.
   * The XDR integration instance incoming mapper is set to `Cortex XDR - Incoming Mapper` and the outgoing mapper is set to `Cortex XDR - Outgoing Mapper`.

* The API includes a limit rate of 10 API requests per minute. Therefore, in a case of a limit rate exception, the sync loop will stop and will resume from the last incident. 

* `Owner` and `closeReason` mappings are done using the integration code, therefore they are not part of the out-of-the-box mapper and should not be specified in any future mapper.

### Fetch Behavior vs Mirroring

Note: All incidents, including those with a "resolved" status, will be fetched into Cortex XSOAR as "active" incidents to enable the execution of our automations. However, the original resolved status of the incidents will be preserved in the incident details. If you prefer to keep certain incidents closed, you can utilize the "Incident Statuses to Fetch" filter during the configuration stage and choose not to import those specific incidents. Alternatively, you can utilize pre-processing rules to define specific types of incidents to be imported as closed.

Regarding mirroring, if you have already imported an incident and the mirroring feature is enabled, changing the incident's status to resolved on the Cortex XDR platform will trigger the mirroring process, resulting in the closure of the incident in Cortex XSOAR.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### xdr-get-incidents

***
Returns a list of incidents, which you can filter by a list of incident IDs (max. 100), the time the incident was last modified, and the time the incident was created.
If you pass multiple filtering arguments, they will be concatenated using the AND condition. The OR condition is not supported.

## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Both |  |


Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response.
### xdr-endpoint-alias-change
