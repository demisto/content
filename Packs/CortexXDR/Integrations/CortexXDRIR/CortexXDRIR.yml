Note that once this value is changed and synchronized between the systems, additional changes will not be reflected. For example, if you change the owner in Cortex XSOAR, the new owner will also be changed in Cortex XDR. However, if you now change the owner back in Cortex XDR, this additional change will not be reflected in Cortex XSOAR. In addition, for this change to be reflected, the owners must exist in both Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR.
