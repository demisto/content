    additional changes will not be reflected. For example, if you change the owner
    in Cortex XSOAR, the new owner will also be changed in Cortex XDR. However, if
    you now change the owner back in Cortex XDR, this additional change will not be
    reflected in Cortex XSOAR. In addition, for this change to be reflected, the owners
    must exist in both Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR.
