The Network Lists API enables you to manage a common set of lists for use in various Akamai security products such as 
Kona Site Defender, Web App Protector, and Bot Manager.
Network lists are shared sets of IP addresses, CIDR blocks, or broad geographic areas. In addition to managing your 
own lists, you can also access read-only lists that Akamai dynamically updates for you.
 
To generate API keys go to the [Akamai Control Panel](https://control.akamai.com/). For detailed instructions, see the integration documention.
