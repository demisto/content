#### Integrations
##### Akamai WAF
- Adding one new command and modifying two commands.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/akamai:1.0.0.48112*.

Command added:
acknowledge_pre_verification_warning
This command is to acknowledge the pre-verification warning message after initiate an enrollment change. When there is a conflict between the existing certificate and the new certificate, there will be a warning message popped out, which needs to be acknowledged either manually or automatcally by API Call. This command is the one to acknowledge the warning. After it is acknowledged, the status of the enrollment will move to the next phase.


Command modified:
list_enrollments: 
Changing the read timeout value from 60 to 180 to avoid the potential timeout issue.

clone_appsec_config_version:
Adding a new parameter "rule_update" .
This is to allow "rule_update" can be set to "False" thus the command execution will take less than 60 seconds by eliminating rule schema update.
And for any Akamai deployment with "ASE" enable for Security configuration, rule schema update is conducted automatically anyway.
