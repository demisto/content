  Indicators thresholds:
  
  Configure the default threshold for each indicator type in the instance settings.
  
  Note that it is also possible to specify the threshold when runing the command.
  
  Indicators with positive results equal or bigger than the threshold will be considered malicious.
  
  Indicators with positive results equal or bigger than half of the threshold value, and lower than the threshold, will be considered suspicious.
