## What makes Cyren unique



Cyren Inbox Security establishes a continuous, adaptive and automated layer of security right in the user mailbox, where it is needed most. Delivered as a native cloud service, Cyren Inbox Security provides:



- **Continuous Monitoring and Detection** <br>

Persistent rescanning of inbound, outbound and delivered emails in all folders assures prompt detection of evasive attack indicators, while real-time analysis of user and mailbox behaviors identifies anomalies that point to a possible threat.

- **Automated Response and Remediation** <br>

Policy-based response framework automates remediation actions in individual mailboxes and across all mailboxes in the organization, while automated incident and case management workflows further reduce investigative overhead and accelerate threat resolution.
