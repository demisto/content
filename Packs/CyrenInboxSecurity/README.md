Evasive phishing, BEC and fraud attacks are getting past existing email defenses. The sophistication of these attacks helps them avoid perimeter detection and fool your employees, including those whoâ€™ve been through Security Awareness and Training programs.

## What makes Cyren unique

Cyren Inbox Security establishes a continuous, adaptive and automated layer of security right in the user mailbox, where it is needed most. Delivered as a native cloud service, Cyren Inbox Security provides:

- **Continuous Monitoring and Detection** <br>
Persistent rescanning of inbound, outbound and delivered emails in all folders assures prompt detection of evasive attack indicators, while real-time analysis of user and mailbox behaviors identifies anomalies that point to a possible threat.
- **Automated Response and Remediation** <br>
Policy-based response framework automates remediation actions in individual mailboxes and across all mailboxes in the organization, while automated incident and case management workflows further reduce investigative overhead and accelerate threat resolution.
- **Crowd-sourced user detection** <br>
Our seamless mailbox plugin lets users scan and report suspicious emails at will, and automatically close the feedback loop on alerts, which reinforces your security training and provides valuable crowdsourced threat intelligence that is fed back into the system to improve threat detection.
