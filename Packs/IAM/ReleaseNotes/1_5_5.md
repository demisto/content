#### Playbooks
##### IAM - Activate User In Active Directory
- Now checks if the user is enabled in Active Directory before initializing it, instead of querying the User Profile indicator.

##### IAM - Rehire User
- Fixed a bug where the user was automatically enabled when rehired.

#### Scripts
##### IAMLinkToUserProfile
- Fixed an issue that caused IAM incidents to show an error in the layout.
