#### Playbooks
##### IAM - Sync User
- Fixed an issue in the User Profile search query which could fail the detection of existing User Profiles.
- Fixed an issue where the User Profile was not marked as processed, which could lead to duplicate incident generation.
- Added a task that allows the user to choose what action to run when a partial name match is detected between an existing employee and a new employee.
- When an orphan user is found (deleted from the HR report in either Wand or Workday), the user can intervene to choose what action to run.
- Added a task that calls a non-implemented subplaybook called ***IAM - Custom User Sync*** to allow customizing the user sync process easily with additional steps.
##### IAM - Activate User In Active Directory
- Fixed an issue where the user manager was not added to the welcome email's CC address.
- Welcome emails will not be sent to the user's manager for acquisition hires.
- Added a playbook input to configure an interval between the activation of a user and the sending of the welcome email.
- Added the option of manual admin approval for activation of users with past hire dates.

##### IAM - Custom User Sync
- Added an empty playbook to allow easy customization of the user sync process without having to detach the main ***IAM - Sync User*** playbook.
