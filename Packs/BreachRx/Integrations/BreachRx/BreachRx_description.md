## BreachRx Help
To obtain your BreachRx API key, you must be logged in as admin:

1. Click "API Keys" in the left navigation menu, under "Admin".
2. Click "New" in the upper right of the page.
3. Copy *both* the API Key and Secret Key.

The "BreachRx URL" is the URL you use to view the site (e.g. https://company.app.breachrx.io), and should be specific to your organization.  Please only copy the domain name.

Only change the GraphQL API URL if you know what you're doing.
