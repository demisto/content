The Threat Connect feed provides access to published IOCs that contain known indicators. You can configure the number of indicators to be returned. The default is 500.

In order to access the ThreatConnect feed, you'll need to generate an access key and an API secret key. Instruction can be found [here](https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/quick_start.html#creating-an-api-key).
