# Authentication
### Authentication Based on Azure Active Directory Applications

Microsoft integrations (Graph and Azure) in Cortex XSOAR use Azure Active Directory applications to authenticate with Microsoft APIs. These integrations use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication services, which use an Application to sign-in or delegate authentication. For more information, see the Microsoft identity platform overview.

There are 2 application authentication methods available:

 * [Cortex XSOAR Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#cortex-xsoar-application)
 * [Self-Deployed Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#self-deployed-application)

Depending on the authentication method that you use, the integration parameters might change.

To allow us access to Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, an admin has to approve our app using an admin consent flow, by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-defender-atp).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key, which should be inserted in the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.

## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Active Directory Users (Self deployed Azure App)

There are two different authentication methods for self-deployed configuration: 
- [Client Credentials flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exposed-apis-create-app-webapp?view=o365-worldwide)
- [Authorization Code flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exposed-apis-create-app-nativeapp?view=o365-worldwide)
### Authentication Using the Authorization Code Flow
**Note**: When using the Authorization Code Flow, make sure the user you authenticate with has the required role permissions. See [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/initiate-autoir-investigation?view=o365-worldwide#permissions) as an example.
1. To use a self-configured Azure application, add a new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal. To add the registration, see this [Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-create-app-web?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-app) steps 1-8.
2. In the **ID** field, enter your Client/Application ID. 
3. In the **Key** field, enter your Client Secret.
4. In the **Token** field, enter your Tenant ID .
5. In the **Authentication Type** field, select the **Authorization Code** option.
6. Mark **Use a self-deployed Azure Application** as true.
7. In the **Application redirect URI** field, enter your Application redirect URI.
8. Save the instance.
9. Run the `!microsoft-atp-generate-login-url` command in the War Room and follow the instruction.

### Authentication Based on Azure Managed Identities
##### Note: This option is relevant only if the integration is running on Azure VM.
Follow one of these steps for authentication based on Azure Managed Identities:

- ##### To use System Assigned Managed Identity
   - Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox and leave the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field empty.

- ##### To use User Assigned Managed Identity
   1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) -> **Managed Identities**.
   2. Select your User Assigned Managed Identity -> copy the Client ID -> paste it in the **Azure Managed Identities Client ID** field in the instance settings.
   3. Select the **Use Azure Managed Identities** checkbox.
