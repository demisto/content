  Isolates a specific machine from the network.
  Isolation is a critical response action that aims to contain potential threats by restricting the machine's ability to communicate with other devices or systems.
  There are typically two types of isolation that can be specified:
  - **Full Isolation**: Use when the threat level is critical. It completely blocks all network traffic to and from the machine.
  - **Selective Isolation**: Suitable when some connectivity is necessary for business continuity, while still minimizing the risk.
args:
  - description: A comma-separated string of machine IDs to be used for isolation. e.g., 0a3250e0693a109f1affc9217be9459028aa8426,0a3250e0693a109f1affc9217be9459028aa8424.

outputs:
  - underlyingoutputcontextpath: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.Status
    description: Represents the current progress or outcome of the machine action, such as 'Pending', 'InProgress', 'Succeeded', or 'Failed'. Indicates whether the action is completed or ongoing.
    type: string
    name: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.Status
  - underlyingoutputcontextpath: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.ComputerDNSName
    description: The DNS name (domain name) of the machine on which the action was executed, used for network identification and resolution.
    type: string
    name: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.ComputerDNSName
  - underlyingoutputcontextpath: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.CreationDateTimeUtc
    description: The exact date and time (in UTC format) when the machine action was created or initiated, represented in the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSSZ' (e.g., 2025-05-08T08:28:47.3412034Z). Useful for tracking the timeline of incident response.
    type: date
    name: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.CreationDateTimeUtc
  - underlyingoutputcontextpath: MicrosoftATP.MachineAction.LastUpdateTimeUtc
    description: The most recent date and time (in UTC format) when the status of the machine action was updated, represented in the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSSZ' (e.g., 2025-05-08T08:28:47.3412034Z). Reflects the latest progress or change in state.
