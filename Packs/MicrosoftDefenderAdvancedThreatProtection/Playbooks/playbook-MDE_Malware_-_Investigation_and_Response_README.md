| DetonateFile | Whether file detonation is allowed on the sandbox. | True | Optional |
| EnableDeduplication | Whether the deduplication playbook will be used. | True | Optional |
| BenignTagName | The name of the tag to apply for allowed indicators. | BenignTagName | Optional |
| RunInvestigationActivities | Choose True to automatically run investigation activities (this relies on the `ActionTask` input ). | True | Optional |
| AdvancedHunting | Choose True to run Advance Hunting queries through your Microsoft Defender For Endpoint instance. Note - It may take some time. | True | Optional |

| DedupCloseSimilar | Defines the threshold of similarity to close a similar incident. All similar incidents with similarity above this value will be closed.<br/>For example, if CloseSimilar is set to .8 and an incident has a similarity score of .9, the incident will be closed.<br/>The value should be between 0 to 1 \[0=low similarity , 1=identical\] | 0.9 | Optional |
| EnableClosureSteps | Whether to use closure steps or close the incident automatically | True | Optional |
| TicketProjectName | If using Jira, specify the Jira Project Key (can be retrieved from the Jira console). |  | Optional |
| AutoCollectinvestigationPackege | Choose True to autorun collecting the investigation package from an endpoint. | False | Optional |
| ActionTask | Option for input (can be comma-separated values):<br/>\`Full Scan\` - Fully scan the provided endpoints<br/>\`Collect Investigation Package\` - Collect investigation package from endpoints (only for supported devices)<br/>\`Automated Investigation\` - Run Automated Investigation on the provided endpoint<br/>If empty, the actions should be checked manually. |  | Optional |
| AutoAVScan | Choose True to autorun a Full AV Scan on your endpoint. | False | Optional |
| AutoAutomatedInvestigation | Choose True to autorun automated investigation on your endpoint. | False | Optional |
| MaliciousTagName | The tag to assign indicators to block. | MaliciousTagName | Optional |
| AutoUnisolation | Indicates if automatic un-isolation is allowed<br/>    True/False | False | Optional |
| DidAlertOriginateFromSIEM | In case the alert originated from SIEM no need to run the Incident enrichment flow. | No | Optional |
| DedupSimilarTextField | A comma-separated list of incident text fields to take into account when computing similarity. For example command line or URL. | Optional |
| AutoIsolation | Whether endpoint auto isolation is allowed. | False | Optional |
| DedupMinimunIncidentSimilarity | Retain incidents with a similarity score greater than the MinimunIncidentSimilarity.<br/>
    Value should be between 0 to 1 [0=low similarity, 1=identical] | 0.2 | Optional |
| DedupLimit | The maximum number of incidents to query and set to context data.<br/>Default is: 200 | 200 | Optional |
