#####  New: **Microsoft Defender For Endpoint - Collect investigation package**
- This playbook aims to simplify the collection of investigation package retrieval into XSOAR from only supported machines (according to the article -  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/collect-investigation-package?view=o365-worldwide). The playbook receives information regarding the target devices (by hostnames, IPs, device ids), validates that those devices exist, and retrieves the collection package from those machines into the XSOAR console. Note that this action may time and the average size of such a package is around ~15 MB. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0).
