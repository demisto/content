#####  New: **Microsoft Defender For Endpoint - Collect investigation package**
This playbook simplifies retrieving investigation packages to Cortex XSOAR from supported machines (See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/collect-investigation-package?view=o365-worldwide).  
The playbook receives information about the target devices (host name, IP, and device ID), validates the devices exist, and retrieves the collection package from those machines into the Cortex XSOAR console.  
**Note:**  
This action may take time, the average package size is around ~15 MB.
