#### Playbooks
Added the following new playbooks:
- **Policy Optimizer - Generic** - This playbook is triggered by the **Policy Optimizer** incident type, and can execute any of the following sub-playbooks managing the remediation sub-playbooks.
- **Policy Optimizer - Manage Port Based Rules** - This playbook migrates port-based rules to application-based allow rules to reduce the attack surface and safely enable applications on your network.
- **Policy Optimizer - Manage Rules with Unused Applications** - This playbook helps identify and remove unused applications from security policy rules. If you have application-based security policy rules that allow a large number of applications, you can remove unused applications (applications never seen on the rules) from those rules to allow only applications actually seen in the ruleâ€™s traffic. This strengthens your security posture by reducing the attack surface.
- **Policy Optimizer - Manage Unused Rules** - This playbook helps identify and remove unused rules that do not pass traffic in your environment.
- **New: Policy Optimizer - Add Applications to Policy Rules** - This playbook edits rules with unused applications or rules that are port based, and adds an application to the rule. It includes communication tasks to get a rule name and the application to edit from the user.

#### Scripts
Added the following new scripts:
- **EntryWidgetPortBasedRules** - This entry widget returns the number of port based rules found by PAN-OS.
- **EntryWidgetUnusedApplications** - This entry widget returns the number of rules with unused applications found by PAN-OS policy optimizer.
- **EntryWidgetUnusedRules** - This entry widget returns the number of unused rules found by PAN-OS policy.
