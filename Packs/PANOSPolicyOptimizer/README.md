Automate your AppID Adoption by using the PAN-OS Policy Optimizer (beta) integration and playbooks together with your Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall or Panorama.


## What Does This Pack Do?
The Policy Optimizer integration in this content pack enables you to gain visibility into and control usage of security policy rules.

The playbooks in this pack also help you automate the following procedures to reduce the attack surface and safely enable applications on your network.

- Identify unused rules.
- Identify port-based rules so you can convert them to application-based rules that allow traffic or add applications to existing rules without compromising application availability.
- Identify rules configured with unused applications.
- Analyze rule characteristics and prioritize which rules to migrate or clean up.

As part of this pack, you also get out-of-the-box Policy Optimizer incident views, a full layout, and automation scripts. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.
