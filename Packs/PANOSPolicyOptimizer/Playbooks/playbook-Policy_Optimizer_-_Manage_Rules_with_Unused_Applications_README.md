This playbook helps identify and remove unused applications from security policy rules. If you have application-based security policy rules that allow a large number of applications, you can remove unused applications (applications never seen on the rules) from those rules to allow only applications actually seen in the ruleâ€™s traffic. This strengthens your security posture by reducing the attack surface.
