description: Rapid detection of malicious behaviour can make all the difference in the response to a security event. This pack includes configurations to combine the world-class threat detection of Darktrace with the synchrony and automation abilities of XSOAR, allowing security teams to investigate model breaches and all model breach related actions (such as commenting, acknowledging and model logic info).
