 Error Responses - Timeout Error
-------------------------------

 **Timeout error** indicates that time limitation for the command has exceeded before results are returned.

 To resolve this issue, configure new time limitation for the command.

  

  2. Navigate to **Settings** > **About** > **Troubleshooting** > **Server Configuration**.
 4. click **Add Server Configuration**.
 6. Set the **key** field using this format: FireEye HX.<*command-name*>.timeout.
 8. Set the **value** field to the desired time limit for the command to run (in minutes).
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/ca13780e216a39751600dcb1e386d12f52fc8f25/docs/images/Integrations/FireEyeHX_mceclip0.png)

  

 Known Limitations
-----------------

 ### Acquisitions limitations

  * Acquisitions are stored for 14 days or until the aggregate size of all acquisitions exceeds the acquisition space limit, which is from 30 GB to 9 TB, depending on the HX Series appliance**.** 
 * When the acquisition space is completely full and automatic triages fill 10 percent of the acquisition space, the HX Series appliance reclaims disk space by removing automatic triage collections.
 * When the acquisition space is 90 percent full, no new acquisitions can be created, and bulk acquisitions that are running might be canceled**.** 
  ### Containment Limitations

  * Some hosts cannot be contained.
 * The time it takes to contain a host varies, based on factors such as agent connectivity, network traffic, and other jobs running in your environment.
 * You can only contain a host if the agent package for that host is available on the HX Series appliance.
   

 Command Timeout
---------------

 The following commands have high potential to exceed the default time limit for a running command. To avoid command timeout, change the command timeout settings.

  * fireeye-hx-search
 * fireeye-hx-data-acquisition
 * fireeye-hx-file-acquisition
  ### Configure Command Timeout

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **About** > **Troubleshooting**. 
2. In the **Server Configuration** section, click **Add Server Configuration**.
3. Set the ***Key*** field using this format: FireEye HX.timeout
4. Set the ***Value*** field to the timeout you need (in minutes).
