## To set up an instance, you need to add the following:


### Server URL
The URL of your FireEye account.

### User Name and Password
Your username and password when logging in to your FireEye account.

## Note
There are two types of permissions
1. api_admin role.
2. api_analyst role.

When you have api_analyst permissions, you cannot approve a containment for the host.
You can use with fireeye-hx-host-containment command for sending a containment request.
