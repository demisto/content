As organizations continue to mature their security stack and adopt defense-in-depth practices, it is increasingly important for security operation teams to have their data available in one place, rather than spread across multiple tools.

This integration pack enriches your Cortex XSOAR playbooks with information from Darktrace’s self-learning AI in Darktrace PREVENT. Specifically, this integration pulls data from Darktrace PREVENT /Attack Surface Management. Darktrace PREVENT /ASM continuously monitors your attack surface for risks, high-impact vulnerabilities and external threats.
 
Together with XSOAR, this pack can speed up your triage workflow, boost SOC efficiency and ensure all your security coverage can be found in one place.
 
What does this pack do?
 
This pack pulls Darktrace PREVENT /ASM risks, including evidence of the risk and proposed actions for remediation. Asset information pertaining to the risk is also included. Customers can decide which types of risks are integrated, ensuring visibility is bespoke to your individual SOC’s needs. Risks from the connector will populate in the XSOAR ‘Incidents’ tab.
