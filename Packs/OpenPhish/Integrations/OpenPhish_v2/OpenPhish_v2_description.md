To configure an integration instance, you only need to set the refresh interval. All of the URLs are stored in the integration context and are refreshed according to the refresh interval.

Notice: Submitting indicators using the ***url*** command of this integration might make the indicator data publicly available.  See the vendorâ€™s documentation for more details.
