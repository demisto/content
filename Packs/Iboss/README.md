Note: This is a beta pack, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the pack is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the pack during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the pack to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.

This pack provides the iboss integration module which allows users to manage block lists, manage allow lists, and perform domain, IP, and/or URL reputation and categorization lookups.
