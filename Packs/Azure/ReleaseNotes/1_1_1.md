#### Integrations

##### Azure

- Added support for the **azure-disk-set-data-access-aad-quick-action** command, which sets the managed diskâ€™s data access authentication mode to Azure Active Directory.
- Added support for the **azure-webapp-update-assign-managed-identity-quick-action** command, which assigns a system-assigned managed identity to the Function App. This allows the app to securely access other Azure services without the need to manage sensitive credentials, reducing the risk of exposure.

- Added support for the **azure-acr-disable-anonymous-pull-quick-action** command, which disables anonymous pull access for the Azure Container Registry (ACR), requiring clients to authenticate before pulling images.
- Added support for the **azure-storage-blob-enable-soft-delete-quick-action** command, which enables blob soft delete for the storage account, retaining deleted blobs for 30 days.
- Added support for the **azure-disable-public-private-access-vm-disk-quick-action** command, which disables all public and private network access for the managed disk.
