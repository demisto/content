- Added support for **azure-disk-set-data-access-aad-quick-action**, which sets the managed diskâ€™s data access authentication mode to Azure Active Directory.

- Added support for **azure-storage-blob-enable-soft-delete-quick-action**, which enables blob soft delete for the storage account, retaining deleted blobs for 30 days.
- Added support for **azure-disable-public-private-access-vm-disk-quick-action**, which disables all public and private network access for the managed disk.
