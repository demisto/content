#### Integrations

##### Redmine

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.92207*.
- Fixed an issue with the tracker_id argument to support custom tracker IDs.
- Fixed an issue with the status_id argument to support custom status IDs.
- Fixed an issue with the priority_id argument to support custom priority IDs.
- Updated the status_id argument in the get-issue-list command to status so it will handle both an ID and a predefined status.
- Deleted the status_id argument in the redmine-issue-create command since the API uses the default.
