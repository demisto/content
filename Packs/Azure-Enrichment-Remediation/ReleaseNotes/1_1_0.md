#### Playbooks
##### New: Azure - Network Security Group Remediation
This playbook adds new Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) rules to NSGs attached to a NIC. The new rules will give access only to a private IP address range and block traffic that's exposed to the public internet ([using the private IP of the VM as stated in Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview)). For example, if RDP is exposed to the public internet, this playbook adds new firewall rules that only allos traffic from private ip address and blocks rest of the RDP traffic.
##### New: Azure - Enrichment
Given an IP address, this playbook enriches Azure Compute, Microsoft Graph User, and IAM information and outputs Azure Compute, Microsoft Graph User, and IAM information. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).

#### Scripts
##### New: AzureFindAvailableNSGPriorities
This script takes in a list of numbers that represent Azure priorities for NSG rules, a target priority number, and a number available priorities to return available priorities from the provided list.  (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
