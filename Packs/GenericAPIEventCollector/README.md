# Generic API Event Collector
## Overview
The **Generic API Event Collector** allows you to ingest data from any API endpoint into Cortex.
By configuring this collector, you can gather data from various systems and bring it into the Cortex ecosystem for better analysis and correlation.
**Note:** This pack is currently in **Beta**, and as such, it may be subject to future changes and may not work on all types of APIs and Authentication.

## What Does This Pack Do?
This pack provides an integration that enables you to:
- Collect events automatically from various API sources using the **Generic API Event Collector**.
- Manually fetch events using the `generic-api-event-collector-get-events` command.

## Use cases
- Ingest logs and event data from third-party systems that expose an API.
- Enhance threat detection and correlation by bringing external events into Cortex.
