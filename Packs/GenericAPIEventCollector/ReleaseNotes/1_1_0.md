#### Integrations

##### Generic API Event Collector (Beta)

- Added support for separate pagination response and request fields:
  - `pagination_response_field`: Specifies where to find the next page value in the API response
  - `pagination_request_field`: Specifies what field name to use in the next request
- Added **Next Page Handling** parameter to control how to handle the next page value:
  - 'navigate to it' - follow the URL directly
  - 'move it as a JSON' - send the next page value as JSON in the request's body
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.11.4819260*.
