#### Integrations

##### Analyst1

- **Improved Verdict Accuracy**: Updated XSOAR Verdict calculation to use Analyst1 Risk Score instead of the benign field.
- **New Configuration Parameters**:
  - Added 6 risk score mapping parameters to customize how Analyst1 risk scores (Lowest, Low, Moderate, High, Critical, Unknown) map to XSOAR verdicts (Benign, Unknown, Suspicious, Malicious).
  - Added "Apply Analyst1 entity-type tags to indicators" parameter (default: disabled) to optionally tag indicators with their Analyst1 entity classifications.
- **Enhanced Entity Classification**: Indicators classified by Analyst1 as Assets, Ignored Assets, In Home/Private/System Range, or Ignored Indicators are now marked as benign in XSOAR with appropriate entity-type tags when tagging is enabled.
- **Improved User Experience**: Reputation commands now display clear "not found" messages for indicators that don't exist in Analyst1, and show entity type classifications for non-indicator entities in the war room.
- **Batch Check Improvements**: The analyst1-batch-check-post values parameter now supports both comma-delimited and newline-delimited input formats.
- Updated Docker image to demisto/python3:3.12.11.4819260.
