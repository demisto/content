#### Integrations

##### Analyst1

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.11.4819260*.
- Improved implementation of XSOAR Verdict calculation to use Analyst1 Risk Score instead of the benign field.
- Added 6 risk score mapping parameters to customize how Analyst1 risk scores (Lowest, Low, Moderate, High, Critical, Unknown) map to XSOAR verdicts (Benign, Unknown, Suspicious, Malicious).
- Added the *Apply Analyst1 entity-type tags to indicators* parameter (default: disabled) to optionally tag indicators with their Analyst1 entity classifications.
- Improved implementation of entity classification handling where indicators classified by Analyst1 as Assets, Ignored Assets, In Home/Private/System Range, or Ignored Indicators are now marked as benign in XSOAR with appropriate entity-type tags when tagging is enabled.
- Improved implementation of reputation commands to display clear "not found" messages for indicators that don't exist in Analyst1, and show entity type classifications for non-indicator entities in the war room.
- Updated the ***analyst1-batch-check-post*** command to support both comma-delimited and newline-delimited input formats for the *values* argument.
