## Overview
---

Deprecated. Use Analyst1 integration instead.

This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.8.7 of illuminate
## illuminate Playbook
---
illuminate Basic Indicator Enrichment: This is a simple playbook that can apply on top of an incident created from an indicator that will determine the indicator type and then properly enrich it with the associated illuminate integration command.

## Use Cases
---
* When you wish to have more information on a given indicator
* When you use both Demisto and illuminate and wish to have easy linking between the two

## Configure illuminate on Demisto
---

1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for illuminate.
3. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __illuminate API Credentials (username/password)__
    * __Domain of illuminate server to use__
    * __Trust any certificate (not secure)__
    * __Use system proxy settings__
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Commands
---
You can execute these commands from the Demisto CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
