## Overview
---

Analyst1 is an indicator, countermeasure and sensor management tool that enables analysts to collect and analyze evidence of malicious activity. Analyst1â€™s web based interface provides a single location to collect and analyze evidence of malicious activity and manage indicators then author, test, task and track rules to detect malicious cyber activity. Maintaing traceability between evidence, indicators, rules and sensors, analysts can identify why a rule was created, the type of activity it detects and what sensors are tasked.

This integration utilizes Analyst1's system to enrich Demisto indicators with data provided by the Analyst1 REST API, such as actor and malware information, activity and reported dates, evidence and hit counts, and more.

This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.8.7 of Analyst1
## Analyst1 Playbook
---
Analyst1 Basic Indicator Enrichment: This is a simple playbook that can apply on top of an incident created from an indicator that will determine the indicator type and then properly enrich it with the associated Analyst1 integration command.

## Use Cases
---
* When you wish to have more information on a given indicator
* When you use both Demisto and Analyst1 and wish to have easy linking between the two

## Configure Analyst1 on Demisto
---

1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for Analyst1.
3. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __Analyst1 API Credentials (username/password)__
    * __Domain of Analyst1 server to use__
    * __Trust any certificate (not secure)__
    * __Use system proxy settings__
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Commands
---
You can execute these commands from the Demisto CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
