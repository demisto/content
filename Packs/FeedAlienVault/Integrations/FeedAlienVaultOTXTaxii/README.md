Use the AlienVault OTX integration to fetch indicators using a TAXII client.

This integration can only fetch indicators from **active** collections. Active collections are those which contain at least one indicator.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for AlienVault OTX TAXII Feed.
