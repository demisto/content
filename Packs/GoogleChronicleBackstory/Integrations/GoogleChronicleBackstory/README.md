## Overview
---

Use the Chronicle integration to retrieve Asset alerts or IOC Domain matches as Incidents. Use it to fetch a list of infected assets based on the indicator accessed. This integration also provides reputation and threat enrichment of indicators observed in the enterprise.

## Configure Chronicle on Cortex XSOAR
---

1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for Chronicle.
3. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __User's Service Account JSON__
    * __Provide comma(',') separated categories (e.g. APT-Activity, Phishing). Indicators belonging to these "categories" would be considered as "malicious" when executing reputation commands.__
    * __Provide comma(',') separated categories (e.g. Unwanted, VirusTotal YARA Rule Match). Indicators belonging to these "categories" would be considered as "suspicious" when executing reputation commands.__
    * __Specify the "severity" of indicator that should be considered as "malicious" irrespective of the category.  If you wish to consider all indicators with High severity as Malicious, set this parameter to 'High'. Allowed values are 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low'. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only.__
    * __Specify the "severity" of indicator that should be considered as "suspicious" irrespective of the category. If you wish to consider all indicators with Medium severity as Suspicious, set this parameter to 'Medium'. Allowed values are 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low'. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only.__
    * __Specify the numeric value of "confidence score". If the indicator's confidence score is equal or above the configured threshold, it would be considered as "malicious". The value provided should be greater than the suspicious threshold. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only.__
    * __Specify the numeric value of "confidence score". If the indicator's confidence score is equal or above the configured threshold, it would be considered as "suspicious". The value provided should be smaller than the malicious threshold. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only.__
    * __Select the confidence score level. If the indicator's confidence score level is equal or above the configured level, it would be considered as "malicious". The confidence level configured should have higher precedence than the suspicious level. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only. Refer the "confidence score" level precedence UNKNOWN_SEVERITY < INFORMATIONAL < LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH.__
    * __Select the confidence score level. If the indicator's confidence score level is equal or above the configured level, it would be considered as "suspicious". The confidence level configured should have lesser precedence than the malicious level. This configuration is applicable to reputation commands only. Refer the "confidence score" level precedence UNKNOWN_SEVERITY < INFORMATIONAL < LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH.__
    * __Fetches incidents__
    * __First fetch time interval. The time range to consider for initial data fetch.(&lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;, e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 3 months, 1 year).__
    * __How many incidents to fetch each time__
    * __Backstory Alert Type (Select the type of data to consider for fetch incidents).__
    * __Select the severity of asset alerts to be filtered for Fetch Incidents. Available options are 'High', 'Medium', 'Low' and 'Unspecified' (Default-No Selection).__
    * __Trust any certificate (not secure)__
    * __Use system proxy settings__
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Fetched Incidents Data
---
Fetch-incidents feature can pull events from Google Chronicle which can be converted into actionable incidents for further investigation. It is the function that Demisto calls every minute to import new incidents and can be enabled by the "Fetches incidents" parameter in the integration configuration.

The list of alerts (gcb-list-alerts) or IOC domain matches (gcb-list-iocs) are the two choices that can be configured.
#### Configuration Parameters for Fetch-incidents
 - First fetch time interval. The time range to consider for initial data fetch.(&lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;, e.g. 1 day, 7 days, 3 months, 1 year): **Default** 3 days
 - How many incidents to fetch each time: **Default** 10
 - Select the severity of asset alerts to be filtered for Fetch Incidents. Available options are 'High', 'Medium', 'Low' and 'Unspecified' (Default-No Selection). **Only applicable for asset alerts**.
 - Backstory Alert Type (Select the type of data to consider for fetch incidents):
   - IOC Domain matches **Default**
   - Assets with alerts
