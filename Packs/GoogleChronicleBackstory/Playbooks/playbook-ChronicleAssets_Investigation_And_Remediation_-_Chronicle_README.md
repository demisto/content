Performs enrichment and investigation of the ChronicleAsset type of indicators, provides an opportunity to remediate in case any of the ChronicleAsset information i.e., hostname or IP address is found to be malicious or suspicious, and sends out an email containing the list of isolated and potentially blocked entities. To select the indicators you want to add, go to playbook inputs, choose "from indicators" and set your query. For example, type:ChronicleAsset etc. The default playbook query is "type:ChronicleAsset". In case indicators with different query parameters are to be investigated, the query must be edited accordingly. This playbook needs to be used with caution as it might use up the integrationâ€™s API license when running large amounts of indicators.
