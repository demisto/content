Quickly respond to security incidents by integrating Google SecOps with Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR.

Google SecOps is a cloud service, built as a specialized layer on top of core Google infrastructure, designed for enterprises to privately retain, analyze, and search the massive amounts of security and network telemetry they generate. Google SecOps normalizes, indexes, correlates, and analyzes the data to provide instant analysis and context on risky activity.

Google SecOps instances, APIs and search parameters are all accessible directly within Cortex XSOAR for full automation of playbooks.
