For secure access to Prisma Cloud API, you need a Prisma Cloud API access key. An access key includes an Access Key ID and a Secret Key.
You can use Prisma Cloud UI to generate this required access key.
If you are a multi-tenant user and the body parameters of your login call include a user name and password instead of an access key ID and secret key, then you will also need to provide the Customer name
which can be seen on the tenant menu  in the Prisma Cloud UI.
