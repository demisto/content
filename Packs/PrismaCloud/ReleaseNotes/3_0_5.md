##### Prisma Cloud - Classifier

- Fixed an issue where incidents are not mapped to the "Prisma Cloud - VM Alert Prioritization" incident type. 
- The classifier has been updated to determine the incident type based on the policy name rather than the policy ID. This modification provides a more intuitive understanding of the classification process.
