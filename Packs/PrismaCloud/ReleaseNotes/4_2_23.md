##### Prisma Cloud v2

- Fixed an issue where the output of the ***prisma-cloud-config-search*** command wasn't optimized.
- **Breaking changes:** In order to maintain reasonable response size, the output now lacks 2 values values by default. Use the argument ****include_additional_resource_fields=true**** to include their values in the output.
