- Added an option to refer to sites by their names on relevant commands (previously only by IDs).
- Added `page` and `page_size` parameters for paginated commands.
- Fixed wrong duration time conversion in `nexpose-get-scan` and `nexpose-get-scans` commands.
- Fixed `nexpose-get-asset-vulnerability` command failing with the same message if asset ID is invalid, vulnerability ID is invalid, or if the asset isn't vulnerable for the specified vulnerability.
- Changed `nexpose-get-scan` command behavior to not straight up stop and fail if one of the provided scan IDs is invalid, but instead continue to loop over all IDs and show an error message just for the invalid IDs.
- Fixed `nexpose-get-asset`, `nexpose-get-assets` and `nexpose-search-assets` failing if a returned asset hasn't been previously scanned.
