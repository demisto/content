    - ***nexpose-create-sites-report***
    - ***nexpose-create-scan-report***
    - ***nexpose-create-assets-report***
- Added the ***nexpose-get-report-status*** command, which returns the status of a report generation process.
- Added the ***nexpose-download-report*** command, which downloads a generated report.

#### Playbooks
##### New: Nexpose - Create and Download Report
- Use this playbook as a sub-playbook to configure and download a report.
This playbook implements polling by continuously running the ***nexpose-get-report-status*** command until the operation completes.
The remote action should have the following structure:

1. Initiate the operation - insert the type of the report (sites, scan, or assets) and its additional arguments, if required.
2. Poll to check if the operation completed.
3. Get the results of the operation.
