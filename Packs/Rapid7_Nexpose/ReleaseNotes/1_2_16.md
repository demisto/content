- The sub-playbooks "CVE Enrichment - Generic" and "Calculate Severity - Generic" is no longer in use and has been replaced by the sub-playbooks "CVE Enrichment - Generic v2" and "Calculate Severity - 3rd-party integrations". The old playbook will still be available for six months, after which it will be removed from the marketplace.
