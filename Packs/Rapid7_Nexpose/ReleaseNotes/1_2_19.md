##### Rapid7 InsightVM

- Added the *Number of connection error retries* advanced integration parameter to recover from temporary connection errors during command executions.
- Changed the default value of the *page_size* argument to 100 in the **nexpose-search-assets** command to avoid doing large paginations that could lead to timeouts.
