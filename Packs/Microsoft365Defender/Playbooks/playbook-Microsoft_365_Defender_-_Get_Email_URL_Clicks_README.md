This playbook retrieves email data based on the `URLDomain` and `MessageID` inputs. It uses the Microsoft 365 Defender's Advanced Hunting to search only for URL click events based on the playbook inputs and enriches it with the full email data.

**URLDomain** - If the “URLDomain” value is found as a substring of the URL(s) in the body of the email, the email is retrieved.

**MessageID** - The message ID of the email from which the URL was clicked. Note that this can be either of the following 2 values:
- The value of the header "Message-ID".
- The internal ID of the message within Microsoft's products (e.g., NetworkMessageId).

Can be a single MessageID or an array of MessageIDs to search.
