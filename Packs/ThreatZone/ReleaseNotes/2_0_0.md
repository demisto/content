#### Integrations

##### ThreatZone

- Context outputs now include the `ThreatZone.Submission.*` structure while preserving legacy `ThreatZone.Analysis.*` and `ThreatZone.IOC.*` paths for backward compatibility also new *v2* playbooks are available for the `ThreatZone.Submission.*` outputs.
- Added URL detonation support via the `tz-url-analysis` command, including reporting helpers and HTML report download.
- Expanded sandbox submission options with module toggles, analyze config overrides, archive entrypoint/password handling, and auto environment selection.
- Introduced dedicated commands to retrieve submission sections (`tz-get-indicator-result`, `tz-get-ioc-result`, `tz-get-yara-result`, `tz-get-artifact-result`, `tz-get-config-result`) to fetch granular submission data.
- Enhanced `tz-get-result` formatting: returns the raw submission payload by default, with an optional `details=true` flag to embed inline detail summaries.
- Added a `download_sanitized` flag to `tz-get-result` so CDR runs can fetch sanitized files on demand, and ensured the standalone `tz-get-sanitized` command retrieves files directly.
- Improved plan metadata returned by `tz-check-limits` (includes file size limits, modules, and account information).
- Introduced the **Analyze URL - ThreatZone** playbook to automate URL detonation workflows.
- Updated integration documentation, playbooks, and helper scripts to match the new API capabilities.
