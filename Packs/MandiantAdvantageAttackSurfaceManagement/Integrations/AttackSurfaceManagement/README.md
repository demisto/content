## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Mandiant Attack Surface Management corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:

1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Mandiant Attack Surface Management.
