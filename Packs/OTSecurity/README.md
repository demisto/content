This OT Security pack is created to help you to automate the incident response and threat hunting processes in your Operations and ICS environment.

# Pack Overview

Cortex XSOAR helps to automate OT incidents and alerts response by gathering all relevant data, even from sources that may seem unrelated,
allowing for the buildout of playbooks that cater to the particular automation needs of an ICSâ€™s operational requirements. It also provides bot-aided war rooms where
security analysts and SMEs can safely and securely collaborate on the best course of action. Most importantly, Cortex XSOAR provides automatic documentation of all steps and
processes taken to validate and resolve issues or incidents, creating a knowledge warehouse for first responders.
