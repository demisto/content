## Bitbucket Integration Help

* To create an app password to Bitbucket
  1. Select your avatar (The icon that represent your profile and settings) from the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
  2. Under **Settings**, select **Personal settings**.
  3. On the sidebar, select **App passwords**.
  4. Select **Create app password**.
  5. Give the app password a name, usually related to the application that will use the password.
  6. Select the permissions the App password needs. For detailed descriptions of each permission, see: [App password permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-password-permissions/).
  7. Select the **Create** button. The page will display the **New app password** dialog.
  8. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access. ***The password is only displayed once and can't be retrieved later***.

### Known Limitations
* In order to perform the ***test-module*** command (the "Test" button) add to the **app password**, **Read** permissions to **Projects**. 
* In order to perform the ***bitbucket-issue-create*** command, an issue tracker is required. 
* In order to create an issue tracker, click the relevant repo > Repository settings > Issue tracker, and create it.
