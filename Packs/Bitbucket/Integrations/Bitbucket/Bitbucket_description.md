* To create an app password to Bitbucket
  1. Go to your account -> under **Settings** -> click **Personal settings**.
  2. On the sidebar, select **App passwords**.
  3. Select **Create app password**.
  4. Give the app password a name, usually related to the application that will use the password.
  5. Select the permissions the App password needs. For detailed descriptions of each permission, see: [App password permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-password-permissions/).
  6. Select the **Create** button. The page will display the **New app password** dialog.
  7. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access. ***The password is only displayed once and can't be retrieved later***.

### Known Limitations

* In order to perform the ***bitbucket-issue-create*** command, an issue tracker is required. 
* In order to create an issue tracker, click the relevant repo > Repository settings > Issue tracker, and create it.
