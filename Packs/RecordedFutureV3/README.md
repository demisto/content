# Recorded Future - Pack Documentation

Recorded Future delivers real-time threat intelligence that helps security teams detect, prioritise, and respond to
threats faster.  
The **Recorded Future** pack focuses on alert-handling and brings both **Recorded Future Classic Alerts** and
**Recorded Future Playbook Alerts** straight into Cortex XSOAR so you can triage, investigate, and close alerts without
ever leaving the SOC console.

> **Heads-up:** This pack replaces the alert-centric capabilities that previously lived in the *Recorded Future
Intelligence* pack - namely the *Recorded Future v2* and *Recorded Future - Playbook Alerts* integrations.
>
> See [Guide: Migrating from Recorded Future Intelligence pack](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/Packs/RecordedFutureV3/doc_files/migrate_from_recorded_future_intelligence_pack.md) for more details.

## What does this pack include?

* **Integration - Recorded Future Alerts** - fetch, search, update, and enrich Classic & Playbook alerts.
* **Pre-built content** - incident types, layouts, classifier & mapper so that alerts arrive in XSOAR with the right
  structure and visuals out of the box.

---

## Key capabilities

* **Ingest alerts as incidents** - continuous fetch of both Classic and Playbook alerts with granular filtering (rule
  names, status, category, priority, etc.).
* **Search alerts on-demand** - list alerts from the CLI, automations, or playbooks using flexible query parameters.
* **Update alerts** - change status, add comments/notes, assign analysts, or control reopen behaviour - all from XSOAR.
* **Fetch screenshots** - automatically download and attach the latest screenshots that accompany an alert.
* **Rich UX** - dedicated layouts surface the most relevant context for each alert subtype (Domain Abuse, Vulnerability,
  Facility Risk, etc.).
* **Accurate classification & mapping** - built-in classifier and mapper keep incident fields synchronised with Recorded
  Future.
