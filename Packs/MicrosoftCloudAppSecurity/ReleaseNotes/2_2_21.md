#### Integrations

##### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Event Collector

- Added a retry mechanism for HTTP 500 errors to improve reliability when fetching events.
- Fixed an issue where events were not collected when no limit was set or when the limit was not reached.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/auth-utils:1.0.0.6111183*.
- Added enhanced debug logging to investigate intermittent event collection issues (XSUP-61169).
  - Logs now include human-readable timestamps, time gaps from current time, and detailed API response metadata.
  - Rate limit and retry headers from Microsoft API are now logged when present.
  - Zero-event responses are logged with additional context to help diagnose data availability issues.
  - Timestamp progression is tracked and logged to detect anomalies in event collection.

- Fixed an issue where the `last_run` timestamp was not updated correctly when zero events were returned for a specific event type, potentially causing data loss or duplicate fetching.
- Enhanced debug logging to better track timestamp updates and API responses.
