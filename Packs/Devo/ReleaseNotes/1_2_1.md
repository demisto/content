#### Integrations
##### Devo v2
- Fixed the issue where the plugin was not able to fetch Alerts/Incidents from Devo tables where contents in 'extraData' contains None or 'null' values.
- Fine-tuned some pagination details to avoid memory and broken connection issues.
- Deprecated "Deduplication parameters JSON" parameter since it had no effect in recent versions.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/devo:1.0.0.61805*.
