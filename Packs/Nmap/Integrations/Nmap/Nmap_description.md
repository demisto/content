You can see the options available for running an nmap scan [here](https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html). Some scan options require **root** access for using raw packet scanning techniques. See [here](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) for detailed scanning techniques. If you've configured the server to run Docker images with a non-root internal user and you want to use raw packet scanning (for example via the *-sS* option for SYN/ACK scan), make sure to exclude the *demisto/nmap* Docker image as documented [here](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Run-Docker-with-Non-Root-Internal-Users).
