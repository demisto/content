You can see the options available for running an nmap scan [here](https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html). Some scan options require **root** access for using raw packet scanning techniques. See [here](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) for detailed scanning techniques. If you've configured the server to run Docker images with a non-root internal user and you want to use raw packet scanning (for example via the *-sS* option for SYN/ACK scan), make sure to exclude the *demisto/nmap* Docker image as documented [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/5-5/cortex-xsoar-admin/docker/docker-hardening-guide/run-docker-with-non-root-internal-users.html).
