## HashiCorp Terraform Help


**Note:**
There are 3 different types of tokens - Organization, User, Team
A customer should use a User or Team token that has admin level access to the workspace.
For details, see [HashiCorp API Tokens](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens).

- *Default Workspace ID* can be taken from *Projects & workspaces* within the selected organization.
- *Default Organization Name* can be taken from the organizations listed in [organizations](https://app.terraform.io/app/organizations).
