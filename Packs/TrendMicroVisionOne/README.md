# Key Benefits of XDR with Trend Micro Vision One™
## Prioritized view of threats across the organization

Organizations without an XDR approach ignore nearly double the security alerts as those with XDR capabilities. XDR correlates and combines low level signals into high-fidelity alerts which tell the story of an attack. Security personnel can quickly understand where to focus efforts.
## More effective analysis

With native integration into email, endpoints, servers, cloud environments, and networks, XDR sensors benefit from a deep understanding of data sources. This results in more effective analytics combined with continuously updated detection rules and global threat intelligence from Trend Micro Research, compared to having third-party integration through application programming interfaces (APIs). Organizations with an XDR approach suffered half as many successful attacks.
## Clearer contextual view of threats

By viewing more contextual alerts across more threat vectors, events that seem benign on their own suddenly become meaningful indicators of compromise. This allows you to connect more dots into a single view, simplifying the steps towards achieving an attack-centric view of an entire chain of events across security layers and take response actions from one place. This enables more insightful investigations and gives you the ability to detect threats earlier.
## Stops more attacks, quicker

The net of XDR is better protection for your organization through earlier detection and faster response. According to ESG, those with XDR are 2.2 times more likely to detect a data breach or successful attack in a few days or less, versus weeks or months for those without.
## Reduces time to detect and stop threats

Collapses the time it takes to detect, contain, and respond to threats, minimizing the severity and scope of impact. ESG found that organizations with an XDR approach respond more completely to attacks and were 60% less likely to report that attack re-propagation had been an issue.
## Increased effectiveness and efficiency of threat investigation

By automatically correlating threat data from multiple sources, XDR speeds up and removes manual steps involved in investigations and enables security analysts to quickly find the story of an attack. Organizations with an XDR approach stated it would take eight full time employees to replace the data correlation capabilities of XDR and also are 2.6 times less likely to report their team is overwhelmed.
## Integrated with third-party systems

As you may have other security tools and technologies deployed in your environment, we offer a growing portfolio of open APIs and integrations to third-party systems, such as Palo Alto Networks Cortex™ XSOAR. Trend Micro Vision One™ has the ability to fit within these ecosystems and security operations workflows, acquiring meaningful data from your infrastructure to further enrich and validate your XDR capabilities.
