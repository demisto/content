#### Integrations

##### Trend Micro Vision One Event Collector


##### Trend Micro Vision One V3.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/pytmv1:0.6.2.83411*.
- Added pytmv1 package to make the integration uniform and follow Trend standards.
- Updated get_endpoint_info action to accept multiple endpoints using a comma separated string.
- Multiple requests can now be made for a single action call.
- Added an action to fetch all endpoint activity data and all email activity data where pagination is automatically handled.
- Added an action to fetch endpoint activity data and an action to fetch email activity data where results are limited to the integer value provided for the `top` field.
- Added an action to fetch endpoint activity count and an action to fetch email activity count. This helps in determining whether the user would like to fetch all or only limited results for endpoint or email activity.
- Fixed an issue where the last_event time was causing duplication of incidents.
