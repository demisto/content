#### Integrations
##### XSOAR Mirroring
- Added the boolean `Mirror Playbook ID` parameter. When set to `false`, the receiving instance will run the default playbook matching the incident type (if one exists). Default is `true`, preseving backwards compatibility.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.9.46032*.
