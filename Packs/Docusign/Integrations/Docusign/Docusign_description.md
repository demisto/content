### Request application consent
To use the DocuSign integration and allow access to DocuSign events, an administrator has to approve our app using an admin consent flow by running the ***!docusign-generate-consent-url*** command.

IMPORTANT: You only need to get consent from a user for a given set of scopes once. In subsequent authentication workflows, you can skip this step unless you are requesting a different set of scopes or authenticating a different user.
Note: After selecting Accept, the user's browser will display a message saying that it can't load the page. You can safely ignore this page and close the tab.
