##### IntSights (Deprecated)

- This update fixes an issue that occurred in version 3.0.0 of the pack, where in case an instance of the deprecated IntSights integration was configured, it is not migrated correctly to the new version of the integration and disappears.
  In case you configured an instance of the deprecated integration only after installing version 3.0.0 of the pack, you will be required to reconfigure it.
