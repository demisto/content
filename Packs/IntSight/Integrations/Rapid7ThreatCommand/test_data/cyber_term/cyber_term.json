They have focused on disputing Israel in cyberspace since 2013 and have recently begun to target the US.\n\nThe AnonGhost Team appears to be headed by Mauritania Attacker. The group targets government, corporate and private websites around the world to bring attention to its extremist agenda. For several years,  AnonGhost‚Äôs activity has primarily involved defacing websites with anti-western, anti-Israel, and anti-Semitic messages, especially during OpIsrael and OpUSA campaigns in recent years. In the past months, Anonghost declared their support of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and focused on targets in the U.S. \n\nIn addition to cyber-attacks, the network has launched a number of software tools designed to enable users to conduct their own cyber-attacks against their targets of choice. For example, in March 2015, AnonGhost alerted its supporters via its social media profiles to a new software which enables users to initiate denial of service (DOS) attacks.\n\nOn March 7, 2022, AnonGhost, affiliated with Anonymous, claimed to have hacked and shut down two Russian SCADA water supply systems.",

Once deployed, it enumerates the physical drives and calls DeviceIoControl to get their device numbers. Then, it wipes the first 0x10000 bytes of each disk, using the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator. The malware continues to enumerate the logical drives as well, wiping every file of each disk with random bytes. In addition, it is assumed that the malware operators use tools, such as Impacket, to move laterally. On some occasions, the malware was deployed alongside the RemCom remote access tool, which may imply a connection between both malware.",

Once deployed, the malware abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software to corrupt compromised devices' files before rebooting the computer. In addition, it corrupts the master boot record (MBR), resulting in boot failure. HermeticWiper disguises as a ransomware, dropping a ransom note with a political message, but in fact deletes the data that is stored on the infected machines and shuts the machines down. \n\nHermeticWiper was used in close proximity to DDoS attacks that hit several Ukrainian government agencies and two of the largest state-owned banks in the country, so it might be an auxiliary tool for such attacks.   \n\nThe malware operators assigned it a digital certificate that was issued under a company named ‚ÄúHermetica Digital Ltd,‚Äù probably in an attempt to add credibility and avoid suspicion.",

The campaign was likely conducted by nation-state sponsored threat actors that targeted European government entities managing the logistics of the Ukrainian refugees (including transportation, budget allocation, administration, and population movement) within Europe.\n\nThe campaign operators were assumed to compromise a Ukrainian armed service member‚Äôs email account to send phishing email messages containing XLS files with malicious macro codes. Once the macro was enabled, a Lua-based malware, SunSeed, was downloaded to the victims‚Äô computers. The malware was likely used as a downloader for second stage payloads that were fetched from a remote command and control (C2) server with the general aim of collecting information about the logistics of the Ukrainian refugees.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the campaign to the UNC1151 APT group (AKA Ghostwriter) that was previously observed targeting NATO personnel; however, Proofpoint researchers noted that this attribution is not definite.",

            "Overview": "The Pandora ransomware group, first reported by cybersecurity researchers in March 2022, has been active since February 2022. The group targets American and Japanese organizations from various sectors, such as automotives, legal, technology, and real estate. There is little information about the group‚Äôs attack vector.\n\nOnce they have infiltrated a system, the threat actors move laterally while stealing and encrypting files, appending to them the .pandora extension. In addition, Pandora creates ransom notes named ‚Äú'Restore_My_Files.txt‚Äù in every folder. The ransom notes provide general information about the breach, contact details for ransom negotiations, and a link to the group‚Äôs data leak site that is used for double extortion purposes. \n\nOn March 10, 2022, Pandora breached the Japanese automotive manufacturer Denso, claiming to steal 1.4 TB of files. The group started to leak the files, including purchase orders, technical schematics, and agreements. Denso confirmed the breach, that impacted its German division, but revealed no information about the extent and nature of information that was allegedly stolen. The company stated that there was no impact on other Denso facilities and no supply chain disruptions.   \n\nPandora is believed to be a rebrand of Rook ransomware due to code similarities. In addition, Rook also breached Denso in December 2021, so it is possible that the breach is ongoing and was conducted by the same group. Some researchers also point out similarities in the executable packer that is used by Pandora and the NightSky ransomware group.",

If so, it avoided erasing data.  <br>  <br>Despite being released in close proximity to other wiping malware targeting Ukrainian organizations, such as HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarities with them and appears to be created separately.

Nokoyawa is assumed to be linked to the Hive ransomware, due to attack chain similarities between the two.<br><br>Like Hive, the Nokoyawa operators use Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation, and legitimate tools, such as the anti-rootkit scanners GMER and PC Hunter, for security evasion. They also use other tools to enhance their attack capabilities, such as Mimikatz for credential harvesting, the Z0Miner cryptojacking malware, and the Boxter Trojan. In addition, Nokoyawa is assumed to be spread via phishing email messages, similar to Hive. <br><br>Nokoyawa differs from Hive in that it uses a different compiler and its encryption routine is based on the BCryptGenRandom API rather than RTLGenRandom API. It uses the hardcoded expression ‚Äúlvcelcve‚Äù and Salsa to encrypt the files and an ECDH key pair to encrypt the key. The encrypted files are appended with the .NOKOYAWA extension or an extension that carries the victim‚Äôs name. The ransom note that is deployed often also carries the victim‚Äôs name, as well as the contact email addresses.  <br><br>Nokoyawa<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;operates an active leak site, in which it publishes the data of victims who refused the group‚Äôs ransom demands.</span>",

            "Overview": "Aberebot is an Android banking Trojan that was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in July 2021. The Trojan primarily targets banking and cryptocurrency applications in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, India, Japan, and Australia. In March 2022, a new Aberebot variant named Escobar started to be distributed among Android users. \n\nAberebot usually spreads via smishing campaigns, in which SMS or instant messages are sent to the victims, enticing them to download a seemingly legitimate application (e.g. Google Chrome) or directing them to phishing websites that are used to steal their credentials. The downloaded app then asks for various permissions, such as Accessibility Service and SMS management. Once granted, the malware is able to steal information from the compromised device. Aberebot can collect contact information, intercept and send SMS messages, collect the installed applications list, trigger overlay attacks to steal credentials, and monitor the device‚Äôs activity. \n\nIn November 2021, a newer version, Aberebot 2.0. was observed. This variant can also use Telegram APIs as a command and control (C2) server to communicate with its operators. Telegram channels are more difficult to be taken down, as the platform does not share user information with law enforcement agencies. In addition, the malware featured new capabilities, such as stealing messages from chatting apps, capturing web browser cookies, and disabling security features, like Google Play Protect.\n\nThe Aberebot developers initially put the malware for sale in underground forums for the price of 7,000 dollars. However, they later announced that ‚Äúdue to personal reasons,‚Äù the malware development stopped; a lifetime license can be bought for 300 dollars and the source code for 3,000 dollars. In addition, they stated that the malware has issues in disabling the Google Play Protect.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In March 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new Aberebot variant named Escobar that was spread as a fake McAfee application. The new variant was added new features, such as the ability to steal data from Google Authenticator and to take control of the infected device using VNC. The malware's author offered its beta version for rent on underground hacking forums. Escobar's renting price was initially $3,000 per month but is expected to rise to $5,000 once its development is finished.   \n\nAmong the companies whose applications were targeted by Aberebot: Barclays, Chase, Capital One, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Akbank, National Australia Bank, Westpac Bank, Coinbase, and BitMarket.",

            "Overview": "TeaBot (AKA Anatsa, Toddler) is an Android banking Trojan that was first observed in January 2021. The Trojan targets banking apps mostly in Europe, in countries such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. It supports six languages: Spanish, English, Italian, German, French, and Dutch. Sometimes, the TeaBot banking Trojan was distributed alongside other banking malware, such as FluBot (AKA Cabassous). <br/><br/>TeaBot usually spreads via smishing campaigns, in which SMS messages are sent to the victims, enticing them to download a seemingly legitimate application, or directing them to compromised websites from which the app could be downloaded. TeaBot uses various types of malicious apps, such as media players (e.g. VLC MediaPlayer), delivery services (e.g. UPS), streaming apps (e.g. TeaTV), and antivirus software (e.g. Kaspersky). Once the app is installed on a victim‚Äôs device, communication with a command and control (C2) server is established and the TeaBot payload is executed targeting predetermined banking apps. <br/><br/>Like other banking malware, TeaBot is capable of collecting system data, accessing the device‚Äôs contact list, intercepting and managing SMS messages, logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, triggering overlay attacks via Accessibility Services to steal credentials and credit card information, and gaining full control of the device. The malware can also steal Google Authentication 2FA codes and disable security software. The obtained data is exfiltrated to a remote C2 server every 10 seconds.<br/><br/>In November 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported on several Android campaigns that took place between August and November 2021, resulting in more than 300,000 infections of Android banking Trojans in the Google Play Store. TeaBot was among the banking Trojans that were used by the Brunhilda dropper operators, to compromise mobile devices and steal valuable information. The threat actor hid the TeaBot Trojan in decoy QR code scanners, PDF scanners, and cryptocurrency apps.<br/><br/>In January 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on another TeaBot campaign, in which 17 variants of the malware were hidden in fake Google Play Store applications. The applications included QR code scanners, device cleaning apps, and weather forecasting apps, that were together downloaded more than 150,000 times. The malicious APKs were distributed via paid Google Ads and ads published in legitimate Android applications, and were fetched from GitHub repositories. The malware was not executed if the device's country code belonged to Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Uruguay, or the United States.<br/><br/>In March 2022, Cleafy researchers reported on a new version of the TeaBot dropper masqerading as a QR code reader. The new TeaBot version can attack home banking applications, insurances applications, crypto wallets and crypto exchanges. In addition, it has advanced obfuscation routines and supports new languages, such as Russian, Slovak, and Mandarin Chinese.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Among the companies whose applications were targeted by TeaBot: Chase, Wells Fargo, \tJ.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, BBVA, ABN AMRO, E*TRADE, Coinbase, Raiffeisen Bank, ING Australia, Westpac One (NZ), and Emirates NBD.",

            "Overview": "The DirtyMoe botnet (AKA NuggetPhantom) has been active since at least 2016. The botnet, assumed to be operated from China, spreads globally, infecting thousands of Windows computers each year, primarily located in Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, and Brazil.\n\nDirtyMoe is usually distributed via phishing email messages with infected files that contain malicious links to websites hosting the PurpleFox exploit kit. PurpleFox leverages various system vulnerabilities, such as EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) and the Hot Potato Windows Privilege Escalation, to gain admin privileges. Using these privileges, the attackers utilize Windows MSI installer to deploy DirtyMoe while abusing the Windows System Event Notification Service (SENS). To evade detection, the MSI installer replaces the SENS system DLL file with a malicious payload and executes it as a legitimate service. In addition, the DirtyMoe operators use VMProtect and file encryption to evade security mechanisms. Once installed, the botnet can be used for cryptojacking and for executing distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS).       \n\nDirtyMoe has worming capabilities, generating and attacking hundreds of thousands of IP addresses that are related to the geological location of the worming module. The attacks can occur hourly or daily based on the worm module‚Äôs configuration.",

            "Overview": "The Diavol ransomware group was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in June 2021. The group is linked to Wizard Spider, a Russian group responsible for TrickBot. \n\nInvestigation of TrickBot samples lead to the discovery that besides the usual Conti ransomware payload, TrickBot delivered previously unseen ransomware that security researchers dubbed Diavol. Conti and Diavol ransomware strains seem similar, as they both use asynchronous input/output operations for file encryption and utilize command-line parameters for the same functionality, such as logging, drives and network shares encryption, network scanning.\n\nHowever, there are several differences between the ransomware families. For example, Diavol lacks the data-exfiltration capabilities that Conti possesses.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Diavol ransomware's encryption procedure uses user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) with an asymmetric encryption algorithm, which sets it apart from other ransomware families as they commonly use symmetric algorithms to significantly speed up the encryption process.\n\nDiavol also lacks any obfuscation as it does not use packing or anti-disassembly tricks, but it still manages to make analysis harder by storing its main routines within bitmap images.\n\nWhen executing on a compromised machine, the ransomware extracts the code from the images' PE resource section and loads it within a buffer with execution permissions.\n\nThe code it extracts amounts to 14 different routines that will execute in the following order:\n\n    ‚Ä¢ Create an identifier for the victim\n    ‚Ä¢ Initialize configuration\n    ‚Ä¢ Register with the C&C server and update the configuration\n    ‚Ä¢ Stop services and processes\n    ‚Ä¢ Initialize encryption key\n    ‚Ä¢ Find all drives to encrypt\n    ‚Ä¢ Find files to encrypt\n    ‚Ä¢ Prevent recovery by deleting shadow copies\n    ‚Ä¢ Encryption\n    ‚Ä¢ Change the desktop wallpaper\n\nDiavol ransomware will change each encrypted Windows device's background to a black wallpaper with the following message: \"All your files are encrypted! For more information see README-FOR-DECRYPT.txt\".\n\nIn August 2021, IBM X-Force researchers further established the link between Diavol and Wizard Spider, by finding similarities to other malware that has been attributed to the cybercrime group. They also found that Diavol's source code has the ability to terminate arbitrary processes and that it prioritizes file types to encrypt, based on a pre-defined list set by its operator. In addition, the HTTP headers used for Diavol's command and control (C2) communication are set to prefer Russian language content, and it contains language checks to prevent it from operating on users from Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This also strengthens the connection to the Russian Wizard Spider group.\n\nIn January 2022, the FBI formally linked between Diavol and Wizard Spider. The FBI is assumed to learn about the connection following the arrest of a Latvian woman named Alla Witte, who was involved in ransomware development for Wizard Spider. It was also reported that Diavol's current ransom demands range between 10,000 and 500,000 dollars, and that the group's ransom notes are now named \"Warning.txt.\"\n\nIn March 2022, Emsisoft released a free decryptor for Diavol. Instructions on how to apply the decryptor can be found here: https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/howtos/emsisoft_howto_diavol.pdf",

A sample of the malware code and ransom note that was analyzed by security researchers indicated that it was compiled on May 17, 2021. At the same time, a reputed ransomware operation, DoppelPaymer (RaaS), seems to have suspended their activity (around May 6, 2021) and there was significantly less activity on the group‚Äôs data-leak website. The researchers‚Äô findings that the ransom link redirected to the DoppelPaymer ransom website, together with the suspension of public activity indicates that DoppelPaymer may have rebranded under the name Grief, and developed new infrastructure. \n\nGrief uses 2048-bit RSA and 256-bit AES, same as the encryption algorithms and distribution channel (Dridex) of the DoppelPaymer malware.

            "Overview": "The Exotic Lily threat group was first observed by Google researchers in September 2021. The financially-motivated group serves as an initial access broker for the global operations of the Conti and Diavol ransomware groups and seems to be also involved with the notorious threat groups Wizard Spider and FIN12. Exotic Lily greatly overlaps with a group that is tracked by Microsoft as DEV-0413.\n\nThe threat actors initiate phishing campaigns, distributing up to 5,000 email messages a day. The messages are usually sent from spoofed domains that are identical to real domain names of existing organizations, with the TLD being replaced with .us, .co, or .biz. To add more credibility, Exotic Lily sometimes creates fake personas posing as employees of genuine companies, while generating fake social media profiles, personal websites, and even fabricating AI-designed profile pictures. The group uses lures, such as business proposals, and even engages in further negotiations to build a relationship with their target. Once gaining the victim‚Äôs trust, the threat actors upload the malicious payload via public file-sharing services (e.g. TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer, or OneDrive) and then use a built-in email notification feature to share the file with the target. This way the final email message carries the mail address of a legitimate file-sharing service and not the one that is used by the threat actors, which helps them evade security mechanisms. \n\nExotic Lily initially distributed malicious documents with an exploit for a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft MSHTML (CVE-2021-40444) but later was observed delivering ISO archives that contained concealed BazarLoader DLLs and LNK shortcuts. Since March 2022, the group has used the ISO archives to include a DLL with a custom malware loader, Bumblebee. Bumblebee uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to collect general system information, such as OS version and domain name, and then exfiltrates it to a remote command and control (C2) server. In addition, it can fetch secondary payloads, such as Cobalt Strike.\n\nExotic Lily‚Äôs members seem to work in a 9 to 5 model during weekdays, in a Central or Eastern Europe time zone, with little activity over the weekends.",

To protect traffic, the malware uses ZLIB compression, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding. Once deployed, B1txor20 can be used to perform 14 different commands that are received from the C2 server, such as creating reverse shells, executing arbitrary commands, installing rootkits, opening SOCKS5 proxies, and sending sensitive information to the C2 server.",

            "Overview": "The DarkHotel threat group, first reported in November 2014, has been active since at least 2007. It targets hotel and business center WiFi, physical connections, and peer-to-peer and file-sharing networks. The APT group usually gains initial access via spear phishing messages with highly-advanced Flash zero-day exploits\n\nDarkHotel‚Äôs most unusual characteristic is that for several years it maintained a capability to use hotel networks to follow and hit selected targets as they travel around the world. These travelers are often top executives from a variety of industries doing business and outsourcing in the APAC region. Targets have included CEOs, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors, and top R&D staff. This hotel network intrusion set provides the attackers with precise global scale access to high-value targets. \n\nIn order to pollute P2P networks to infect the chosen hotel infrastructure, DarkHotel delegitimizes certificate authorities to further their attacks, by abusing weakly implemented digital certificates to sign their malicious files.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In 2015, Kaspersky researchers identified the use of spoofed, malicious RAR attachments using right-to-left override (RTLO) technique, spear phishing, and the deployment of a Flash zero-day from this APT.\n\nIn June 2016, Microsoft researchers reported that they reverse engineered the first stage payload of the malware used by this APT dubbed DUBNIUM. The researchers reported that the malware used in the DarkHotel attacks disguises itself as a Secure Shell (SSH) certificate generation tool. \n\nIn July 2017, Bitdefender researchers reported about a new DarkHotel campaign which they dubbed Inexsmar. This campaign differs from other campaigns as the threat actors targeted political figures rather than corporate research and development personnel, CEOs, and other senior corporate officials.\n\nIn August 2019, Trend Micro researchers claimed that the Asruex malware has been known for its backdoor capabilities and is in use by the DarkHotel APT.\n\nIn January 2020, DarkHotel used Microsoft Office documents for targeted attacks using a zero-day in Internet Explorer. \n\nIn March 2020, the APT attacked the World Health Organization (WHO), amidst the COVID-19 pandemic outburst. It is assumed that threat actors looked for information on tests, vaccines, or trial cures.\n\nIn April 2020, researchers from Qihoo 360 identified attacks against at least 200 VPN servers around the world. The attack was carried out using a zero-day exploit that exists in an update that is triggered automatically when the VPN client starts to connect to the server. According to the researchers, ‚ÄúThe client will obtain [an] update from the configuration file at a fixed location on the connected VPN server, and download a program called SangforUD.exe.‚Äù\nDue to the fact that the client doesn‚Äôt make any security checks before downloading the executable, the attackers can hijack the session, alter the update configuration file, and replace the update program with their own malicious code.\n\nIn May 2020, ESET researchers discovered a previously unreported cyberespionage framework that they dubbed Ramsay. This framework collects and exfiltrates sensitive documents and it is capable of operating within air‚Äëgapped (Isolated) networks.\n\nIn August 2020, researchers from the Chinese security firm Qihoo 360 analyzed a Trojan sample that they attributed to DarkHotel. This Trojan is hijacking and replacing the print spooler service thinmon.dll in order to inject a backdoor with abilities as a keylogger, screen capture, and file theft.\n\nIn March 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new DarkHotel campaign that was initiated between November 2021 and January 2022. The campaign targeted hotels in Macao using Excel files with malicious macro codes. Once the macro was enabled, it loaded the Task Scheduler Service that was used to execute malicious payloads for data collection purposes. In some cases, the threat actors impersonated government entities, such as the Macao Government Tourism Office and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.    \n\nKaspersky researchers published recommendations on how to best protect against the DarkHotel attacks:\n- When accessing public (or even semi-public) WiFi, always use trusted VPN tunnels. The VPN can give you an encrypted barrier to keep out infected servers from feeding malware bait into your connection.\n- Learn and understand the red flags of spear phishing attacks. Odd spelling in the sender‚Äôs email address and a prompt to open a link or attachment can be caution signs. Attackers tend to use urgency and heighten your emotions to get you to take immediate action and compromise yourself. An increase in panic, fear, or curiosity can also indicate risks.\n- Verify the authenticity of the email via official phone numbers or in-person contact when possible. Do not use any contact information found within the email as it could also be fraudulent.\n- Maintain and update all system software. Security patches for existing, known software vulnerabilities are packaged in software updates. You should download updates promptly, provided you have verified through official vendor channels that they are not false.\n- Always verify executable files and treat files shared over P2P networks with caution and suspicion. Again, these files can easily be bait for malware infections. Even legitimate files can be modified for a hacker‚Äôs benefit.\n- When traveling, try to limit software updates. If you can avoid accepting any software updates while away from secure workplace networks, you can minimize your risks of these known hotel WiFi exploits.\n- Install quality Internet security software. Make sure it includes proactive defense against new threats rather than just basic antivirus scanning and malware removal. Web protection like link threat-scanning and phishing filters can help combat threats like those used by DarkHotel.",

            "Overview": "The InvisiMole threat group (AKA UAC-0035), first reported by ESET researchers in June 2018, has been active since at least 2013. The cyberespionage group targets military and diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe, specifically in Russia and Ukraine. It is linked to the Russian APT group Gamaredon (AKA Primitive Bear), conducting joint operations.\n\nInvisiMole seems to rely on Gamaredon for providing initial system access, but was also observed actively sending phishing email messages to distribute malware. The threat actors deliver their malicious payloads via four different execution chains, using living off the land techniques (LotL). To stay undetected and maintain persistence they use vulnerable executables of legitimate tools, such as Total Video Player and the SpeedFan utility. In addition, they employ DNS tunneling for stealthy command and control (C2) communications and encrypt some of the payloads using Data Protection API (DPAPI). \n\nInvisiMole deploys a modular spyware of the same name that has two modules acting as backdoors, RC2FM and RC2CL. RC2FM can track geolocation, open user webcams, take screenshots, record audio, and steal documents. It also uses Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) to steal photos from mobile devices that are connected to the compromised computer. RC2CL can execute files, manipulate registry keys, activate remote shells, scan wireless networks, list installed software, and more. The threat actors move laterally in the compromised system by leveraging various vulnerabilities, such as the BlueKeep vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708) in the RDP protocol and the EternalBlue vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) in Microsoft‚Äôs Server Message Block (SMBv1), and by weaponizing documents and software installers that exist in the system.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In March 2022, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) warned against InvisiMole phishing campaigns targeting Ukrainian organizations and spreading the LoadEdge backdoor. The threat actors sent phishing email messages that contained ZIP archives with shortcut LNK files. Once the LNK file was opened, an HTA file was deployed and executed a VBScript to fetch and decode the backdoor. The backdoor established a connection to a C2 server and downloaded additional malicious payloads, such as the RC2FM and RC2CL spyware, and also TunnelMole, abusing the DNS protocol to form a tunnel for malicious software distribution.        \n\nMITRE ATT&CK¬Æ TTPs: \n\nT1196 - Control Panel Items\nT1106 - Execution through API\nT1129 - Execution through Module Load\nT1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution\nT1085 - Rundll32\nT1053 - Scheduled Task\nT1064 - Scripting\nT1035 - Service Execution\nT1204 - User Execution\nT1050 - New Service\nT1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\nT1053 - Scheduled Task\nT1023 - Shortcut Modification\nT1088 - Bypass User Account Control\nT1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\nT1480 - Execution Guardrails\nT1143 - Hidden Window\nT1066 - Indicator Removal from Tools\nT1202 - Indirect Command Execution\nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1055 - Process Injection\nT1108 - Redundant Access\nT1085 - Rundll32\nT1064 - Scripting\nT1063 - Security Software Discovery\nT1099 - Timestomp\nT1036 - Masquerading\nT1046 - Network Service Scanning\nT1518 - Software Discovery\nT1082 - System Information Discovery\nT1124 - System Time Discovery\nT1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services\nT1080 - Taint Shared Content\nT1043 - Commonly Used Port\nT1090 - Connection Proxy\nT1024 - Custom Cryptographic Protocol\nT1132 - Data Encoding\nT1008 - Fallback Channels\nT1105 - Remote File Copy\nT1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol\nT1095 - Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol\nT1065 - Uncommonly Used Port",

            "Overview": "The Serpent backdoor was first reported by cybersecurity researchers in March 2022. The malware targets French organizations in the construction, real estate, and government sectors. Serpent‚Äôs name stems from parts of the macro code, used to deploy it, and include an ASCII art depicting a snake. The ASCII art also contains the word ‚ÄúNaHash‚Äù (‚Äúsnake,‚Äù in Hebrew), indicating that the malware may have been created by a Hebrew-speaking developer.   \n\nSerpent, written in Python, is distributed via phishing email messages that contain Microsoft Word documents with malicious macro codes. The messages impersonate a known and legitimate entity, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations agency (GDPR). Once the macros are enabled, a JPG file is fetched from a remote URL, containing a base64 encoded PowerShell script that is concealed in the image using steganography. The PowerShell script downloads the Chocolatey Windows package manager that is used to install the pip Python package installer and the PySocks library. Then, another JPG is downloaded, which contains a base64-encoded Python script that executes a BAT file that deploys the Serpent backdoor. Once deployed, the malware communicates with a remote command and control (C2) server and receives commands to be executed on the compromised system, such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, and gaining remote system control. \n\nSerpent is assumed to be operated by a sophisticated threat actor, due to the use of steganography and the Chocolatey utility, which has never been observed to be leveraged before on cyberattacks. In addition, it uses schtasks.exe, a novel technique to execute any requested portable executable file while bypassing detection by security mechanisms.",

            "Overview": "The Storm Cloud threat group has been active since at least 2018. This Chinese APT group targets organizations across Asia, specifically focusing on Tibetan entities.\n\nStorm Cloud usually gains initial access via strategic web compromises while exhorting victims to download and install malicious software pretending to be legitimate (e.g. an Adobe Flash update). These malicious software are used to distribute various types of malware, such as PLUGDAT, STITCH, GOSLU, BRAINDAMAGE, and the custom GIMMICK malware. \n\nGIMMICK has a Windows variant written in .NET and Delphi and a macOS variant written in Objective C. To evade detection, it usually impersonates a software that is frequently used by the user. Once installed, it connects to a command and control (C2) server by establishing a session with Google Drive using hardcoded OAuth2 credentials. Then, it loads three malware components, DriveManager, FileManager, and GCDTimerManager, to manage the C2 communication. GIMMICK can execute commands that it receives from the C2 server, such as uploading and downloading files, exfiltrating general system information, and overwriting client work period information. In addition, it can uninstall itself and all of its associated files. On March 17, 2022, Apple issued new signatures for its XProtect suite and malware removal tool (MRT) that should block GIMMICK and remove it from infected devices.       \n\nStorm Cloud is considered to be a sophisticated threat group, supporting attacks against multiple operating systems. The large and complex GIMMICK malware suggests that it is well resourced, probably by the Chinese government.",

This Chinese APT group primarily targets Russian-speaking individuals located both inside and outside of Russia, in sectors such as government, retail, and finance. In March 2022, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) reported that Scarab targeted Ukranian entities amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.    \n\nScarab usually gains initial system access through phishing email messages that contain RAR archives with malicious macro-embedded documents. The group uses lures, either ones adapted to the targeted entity (e.g. economic, military, etc.) or generic lures. Once the document‚Äôs macro code is enabled, it drops a DLL file that contains the HeaderTip backdoor (formerly Scieron). The C++-based malware can collect general system information, such as the computer name and OS version, download and execute additional files, exfiltrate files from the victim‚Äôs computer, delete files, list directories, and move files to other folders. In addition, it can be used as a first-stage malware loader to fetch a tool with rootkit functionalities that can create and terminate processes, read, write, and delete registry entries and directories, launch remote shells, and more.\n\nDespite focusing on Russian-speaking victims and sometimes sending lures written in Russian, there is evidence that Scarab uses the Windows operating system in a Chinese language setting. The threat actor‚Äôs main motivation is assumed to be the collection of geopolitical intelligence.",

The wiper was used to attack the KA-SAT satellite broadband network, owned by Viasat, on February 24, 2022, the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The attack caused satellite service outages and severe communications disruptions in Ukraine and the surrounding areas. In addition, it made 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unreachable. \n\nThe AcidRain operators exploited a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to deploy the malware, which is a Linux MIPS ELF executable. AcidRain first brute-forced the targeted device‚Äôs file names and then moved laterally through the compromised router or modem, wiping every file it could find. The malware executed legitimate management commands on many devices simultaneously, overwriting data and destroying flash memory, SD/MMC cards, and virtual block devices. It was designed to overwrite file contents with up to 0x40000 bytes of data or to use the following input/output control (IOCTL) system calls: MEMGETINFO, MEMUNLOCK, MEMERASE, and MEMWRITEOOB. Once the wiping process was completed, AcidRain rebooted the compromised devices, making them unusable.     \n\nAcidRain shares similarities with the VPNFilter stage 3 plugin ‚Äúdstr,‚Äù a wiper that was previously used by Russian state-sponsored APT groups, such as APT28 (AKA Fancy Bear) and Sandworm. Thus, it is assumed to be operated by the Russian government as well.",

The infostealer is distributed as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) by user monikers ‚ÄúBlackGUARD07‚Äù and ‚Äúblackteam007‚Äù, for the price of $700 or a subscription of $200 per month.\n\nBlackGuard, written in C#, initially performs checks for the presence of a debugger and aborts operation if one is identified. In addition, it blocks all mouse and keyboard inputs to disrupt debugging attempts, terminates all processes that are related to security mechanisms, such as antiviruses, and uses the Sleep() function several times as an anti-sandbox technique. Another method for avoiding detection is the use of dual decoding. The malware that is encoded in an array of bytes is first decoded into ASCII strings during runtime and then into Base64.\n\nOnce all anti-detection routines are completed, BlackGuard creates a storage directory in the compromised machine and starts harvesting various types of data such as user credentials, web browser information (e.g. cookies, history, and autofill), cryptocurrency information, email client data, and instant messaging correspondences. It also takes screenshots of the infected system. The stolen data is sorted into different folders, packed in a ZIP file, and exfiltrated to a Telegram command and control (C2) server via a POST request, along with system descriptors, such as hardware ID and geolocation.       \n\nWhile the identity of the BlackGuard developers is unknown, they are assumed to be Russian or Russian speakers. This is strengthened by the fact that the infostealer stops its operation if the compromised device is located in one of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), e.g. Russia, Belarus, or Azerbaijan.",

            "Overview": "The Cyclops Blink botnet has been used by the Sandworm group (AKA Voodoo Bear) since June 2019. It targets WatchGuard Firebox and other Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network devices, and grants the threat actors remote access to networks. Cyclops Blink is estimated to affect approximately 1% of all active WatchGuard firewall appliances in the world. The most targeted countries are the United States, India, Italy, and Canada.\n\nCyclops Blink, written in the C language, leverages the legitimate firmware update process, and maintains system access and persistence by injecting malicious code and installing repacked firmware images. In addition, the malware is deployed along with modules that are developed to download and execute additional files from a remote command and control (C2) server, collect and send general system information, and update the malware. It uses OpenSSL functions for data encryption, based on AES-256 and RSA-2560. \n\nIn March 2022, Trend Micro researchers reported on a Cyclops Blink variant that can target Asus routers. The Asus module can extract SSD storage information and information about network interfaces. In addition, it can download files from the Internet using DNS over HTTPS (DoH). As opposed to other Cyclops Blink modules, this module does not have an update feature.\n\nIn April 2022, the US government announced that it disrupted the operation of Cyclops Blink. The malware was removed from all identified Watchguard devices serving as command and control servers.",

            "Overview": "Desert Falcons (AKA Arid Viper, APT-C-23, Two-tailed Scorpion) is considered to be the first Arabic language advanced persistent threat (APT) group. They were formed in early 2011 and started operating in 2013. The group comprises dozens of attackers, some who are known by name, that operate from various Arab-speaking locations, such as the Palestinian territories, Egypt, and Turkey. Desert Falcons targets mostly entities in the Middle East, specifically Israel, but has also been observed operating against other countries, such as the United States and South Korea. The group is primarily interested in obtaining sensitive intelligence information and its victims are companies and individuals from various sectors, such as government, military, education, finance, energy, media, trade and commerce, and religion. Currently, it is unclear whether Desert Falcons is state-sponsored.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "The group‚Äôs first major operation was in 2015, dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Arid Viper,‚Äù in which spear phishing email messages were sent to one Kuwaiti organization and to five Israeli-based organizations in the government, transport, infrastructure, military, and academic sectors. Each message contained an .RAR archive file that automatically extracted an .SCR file. Once executed, the .SCR file dropped two other files, one containing a malicious payload and the other containing pornographic content, possibly in order to distract the victim. The dropped malware communicated with the command and control (C2) server and was used to steal documents from the infected systems.  \n\nIn mid-2017, cybersecurity researchers reported that the group used Windows malware dubbed Kasperagent and Micropsia, in attacks aimed mainly at targets in the United States, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Egypt. The malware spread through spear phishing email messages and social media instant messages that contain malicious links. The group also set up various fake news websites with lures leading to a malware download. The malware can steal web browser passwords, take screenshots, record keystrokes, exfiltrate files, and more. In addition, the threat actors used malicious apps, loaded with SecureUpdate and Vamp Android malware. Those apps were used to steal user credentials, record calls, and steal messages and documents stored on Android devices. \n\nLater that year, other mobile spyware, such as FrozenCell, were found to be used by the group. FrozenCell was disguised in fake updates to chat applications like Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, LINE, and LoveChat. It was assumed to target employees of various Palestinian government agencies, security services, Palestinian students, and those affiliated with the Fatah political party.\n\nIn February 2020, the IDF and the ISA (the Israeli NSA) conducted an operation to take down a Hamas-affiliated threat actor associated with Desert Falcons. The threat actor targeted IDF soldiers through dating apps, setting up fake profiles of attractive women to infect their devices with mobile RATs. \n\nIn September 2020, ESET researchers reported that Desert Falcons developed an improved variant of their Android spyware. The new version, dubbed Android/SpyC32.A, was disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered via Google Play (e.g. Threema and WeMessage), and had many features, such as reading notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, recording calls, capturing screenshots, and more.\nLater that year, researchers discovered that the group started using a new variant for the MICROPSIA malware, dubbed PyMICROPSIA, as it was built with Python. The improved malware was able to upload and delete files, record keystrokes, collect system information, exfiltrate files, and download and execute additional malicious payloads.\n\nIn April 2021, Facebook announced that it dismantled the platform infrastructure of two hacking groups, including Desert Falcons, by taking down accounts and blocking domains associated with their activity.\n\nIn October 2021, Qihoo360 researchers discovered samples of Android spyware found in various applications that masqueraded as legitimate applications, such as Threema, Al-Aqsa Radio, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem Guide, and PDF viewer. The malicious apps were claimed to be part of a campaign that was ongoing since 2018, targeting Israeli and Palestinean users. The users are directed to these apps through Facebook posts or WhatsApp messages that direct them to websites from which the APKs can be downloaded. The threat actors, assumed to be Desert Falcons, spread various malware during the campaign, such as SpyNote, Mobihok, WH-RAT, and 888RAT.\n\nIn November 2021, cybersecurity researchers discovered new Android spyware variants used by the group. The spyware masquerades as legitimate update apps (e.g. App Updates, System Apps Updates, or Android Update Intelligence), suspectedly delivered to users via SMS messages linking to downloads. Once installed, the malware communicates with a C2 server and is capable of collecting information about the device's contact list, SMS messages, call logs, and stealing images and documents. In addition, it can record audio, intercept calls, take screenshots, read social media notifications, and disable security apps' notifications.\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported on another campaign by Desert Falcons targeting Palestinian entities. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages with political lures, in order to distribute the Micropsia malware.\n\nIn April 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new Desert Falcons campaign, targeting Israeli individuals and officials working for law enforcement, military and emergency services. In the course of the campaign, dubbed Operation Bearded Barbie, the threat actors created fake Facebook profiles and used social engineering techniques to lure victims into downloading Trojanized messaging applications deploying the VolatileVenom malware or RAR archives that acted as downloaders for the BarbWire backdoor. BarbWire, deployed by the Barb(ie) downloader, could be used for various malicious purposes, such as logging user keystrokes, recording audio, stealing and exfiltrating specific file types, and downloading additional malware. The VolatileVenom Android Trojan was used to steal mobile device data, such as SMS messages, audio, contact list information, and files and images that were stored upon the device.",

            "Overview": "The Machete APT group (AKA APT-C-43) has been active since at least 2010. It targets organizations from various sectors, such as government, military, telecommunications, and energy. The spanish-speaking threat actors primarily focus on cyber espionage in Latin American countries, specifically Venezuela, but were also observed operating in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\n\nMachete usually distributes its malware using social engineering methods, such as spear phishing email messages with self extracting RAR archives or fake blogs with malicious installers (e.g. Nullsoft installers). The malware executables contain Python scripts, which are not commonly used among cyber attackers. The Machete malware is designed to steal information, such as geolocation, keystrokes, stored files, clipboard content, and general system data. In addition, the malware can take screenshots and capture audio from the computer‚Äôs microphone. At the end of the data harvesting process, it is exfiltrated to a remote command and control (C2) server. The APT group was also observed dropping other types of information stealing malware, such as LokiRat.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In June 2020, cybersecurity researchers observed a Machete campaign using a new Python-based backdoor, called ‚ÄúPyark.‚Äù The campaign, dubbed ‚ÄúOperation HpReact,‚Äù targeted Venezuealan military entities and was assumed to support the reactionary forces residing in Colombia in their battle against the Venezuealan government. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages that contained decoy documents with malicious macro codes. Once the macros were enabled, the Pyark malware was deployed with the intent of stealing sensitive information.\n\nAt the end of March 2022, Check Point Research (CPR) published a report detailing three APT groups, including Machete, that took advantage of the Russo-Ukrainian War to compromise organizations. The group used war-related lures to deliver macro-embedded documents to financial institutions in Nicaragua and government entities in Venezuela. Triggering the malicious macro codes eventually led to the deployment of the Loki.Rat backdoor that could be used for various malicious purposes, such as logging user keystrokes, stealing web browser credentials, taking screenshots, and uploading and downloading files. If the compromised machine was deemed as interesting enough for the threat actors, they deployed another malware, JavaOracle.msi, installing Python-based executables with information stealing capabilities.",

There is little information about Borat‚Äôs specific targets and it seems to support a wide range of malicious purposes.\n\nBorat is offered in the form of a package that includes a builder binary, operative modules, and a server certificate. Each of the modules can perform different malicious activities. The malware can be used to perform DDoS attacks, deliver ransomware payloads and create a ransom note, log user keystrokes, record audio and webcam video, collect general system information (e.g. OS version and system model), steal web browser credentials, set up reverse proxies, inject malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection, and many other activities.\n\nThe Borat RAT shares some similarities with the AsyncRAT, and it is possible that Borat was based on the same code.",

            "Overview": "The Spring4Shell zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965) was first reported by cybersecurity researchers in March 2022. The vulnerability affects the Spring Core Java framework, Spring4Shell, that is maintained by Spring.io, a subsidiary of VMware. Spring is an application framework through which software developers can create Java applications with enterprise-level features and deploy them on servers, such as Apache Tomcat. A Chinese security researcher released a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the flaw, but quickly deleted it.   \n\nThe Spring4Shell flaw enables threat actors to perform unauthenticated remote code execution on targeted systems. It affects the SpringMVC and Spring WebFlux applications running on JDK versions 9 and later, but can be triggered only under specific conditions. According to Praetorian, it requires an endpoint that has DataBinder enabled. \n\nThere are reports that the vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, Spring confirmed the zero-day vulnerability and released Spring Framework versions 5.3.18 and 5.2.20 to address it.\n\nOn April 2, 2022, VMware published security updates for Spring4Shell affecting various of its cloud computing and virtualization products. The complete advisory can be found here: https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0010.html\n\nCISA added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, urging organizations to apply the available fixes promptly.\n\nOn April 8, 2022, Trend Micro researchers reported that the Spring4Shell vulnerability was exploited by threat actors to distribute the Mirai botnet. The observed attack focused on vulnerable web servers in Singapore. The threat actors leveraged the vulnerability to write a JSP web shell into the webroot of the server to enable remote command execution. Then, they downloaded Mirai to the \"/tmp\" folder and executed it with the \"wget.sh\" script, probably to orchestrate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.",

While the malware operators‚Äô initial system access vector was not disclosed, it is assumed that they use stolen AWS access credentials or secret keys to download and execute the malware. To evade detection, the malware uses DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for command and control (C2) communications, concealing the traffic with encrypted connections. \n\nAlthough Denonia was designed to target AWS Lambda environments, it can also run on some Linux systems, such as Amazon Linux boxes.",

The malware is designed to directly control electricity substation switches and circuit breakers. For the malware to be able to achieve these goals, it needs to interrupt the communication between the industrial components using a standard protocol. \n\nAny kind of interruption in these systems can cause different degrees of damage to vital services. The range of actions that can be performed varies from turning components on or off, to damaging the equipment.\n\nThe lack of security makes it easier for hackers to exploit communication protocols without having to search for vulnerabilities.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Industroyer's structure is as follows:\n\n- Main backdoor - its function is to control all the other components of the malware. It communicates with a command and control (C2) server via Tor browser over HTTPS and has a set of commands that it executes and runs out of office hours to reduce detection.\n\n- Secondary backdoor ‚Äì provides an alternative persistence solution in case the main backdoor is detected. The secondary backdoor is a Trojan version of the Windows Notepad application that connects to a different C2 server once detected.  \n\n- Launcher component ‚Äì this is the component responsible for loading the payloads and the data wiper component.\n\n- Payloads ‚Äì the following protocols are reportedly involved in the process:\n‚Ä¢ IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101) ‚Äì monitors and controls electrical power systems. \n‚Ä¢ IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104) extension EC 60870-5-101 ‚Äì allows the protocol to be transmitted over TCP/IP.\n‚Ä¢ OPC DA ‚Äì part of the OPC that allows real-time data exchange between distributed components. When used by attackers, it scans and maps ICS systems that export all the running OPC servers and the items in those servers. \n‚Ä¢ Module 61850 ‚Äì connects to devices within the network that are listed in its configuration file via port 102. If a configuration file is not available, it will enumerate potential IP subnet masks for devices in the network and try to connect to them via port 102. According to ESET's analysis of the payload, it communicates with the targets to identify whether the device controls a circuit breaker switch. For certain variables, it will change their state while also generating an action log.\n‚Ä¢ SIPROTEC-DoS ‚Äì leverages CVE-2015-5374 by sending UDP packets to port 50000, thus causing the SIPROTEC digital relay to fall into an unresponsive state.\n\n- Data wiping tool ‚Äì designed to erase system crucial registry keys and overwrite files in order to prevent tracking and recovery.\n\nUpon installation, the main backdoor tries to connect to an internal proxy server that is hardcoded in its code. It listens on port 3128, which is associated with the Squid proxy. The malware then sends the victim machine's GUID (a unique identifier per Windows installation) to the C2 server. If there is no response from the remote server, the backdoor exits.\n\nIn April 2022, the Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) and ESET researchers reported on a campaign that was carried out by the Sandworm threat group, targeting an ICS network of a Ukrainian energy organization while using a new Industroyer variant dubbed Industroyer2. The new variant uses only the IEC-104 protocol (AKA IEC 60870-5-104) to communicate with industrial equipment. In addition, it is more configurable than its predecessor, and its settings, such as the application service data unit (ASDU) address, Information Object Addresses (IOA), and timeouts, are transferred through the IEC-104 communication routine. Industroyer2 was observed communicating with eight devices at the same time. Before establishing a connection to the targeted devices, the malware terminates a legitimate process that industrial equipment performs in its standard operation.",

It spreads indiscriminately through software cracks, installers, freeware, games, and other files that are downloaded from compromised websites. The malware is named after the Windows registry key \"FFDroider\" that is created upon execution.\n\nOnce the malicious installer is downloaded, the FFDroider is installed, disguised as legitimate software, such as the Telegram desktop app. The malware is designed to steal cookies and account credentials that are stored in Chromium-based web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome), Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. Unlike other infostealers, FFDroider focuses on stealing credentials for social media accounts and eCommerce websites, such as Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, and Etsy. The malware operators can track the infected machines through a dedicated URL called iplogger.org. At the end of the harvesting process, the user credentials are sent as cleartext to a remote command and control (C2) server via HTTP POST. In addition, the malware attempts to upgrade itself and expand its features by downloading additional modules from an update server at fixed time intervals.   \n\nThe FFDroider operators were observed using the stolen credentials to log into the user accounts and steal all the available information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and account billing and payment information. The obtained data can be used to orchestrate malicious ad campaigns on social media to expose FFDroider to a larger audience.",

            "Overview": "The Karakurt extortion group was first observed in June 2021. The financially motivated group targets relatively small organizations from various sectors, such as professional services, technology, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy, primarily based in North America. Karakurt means ‚Äúblack wolf‚Äù in Turkish, and is also a species of a venomous spider found in eastern Europe and Siberia.<br><br>Karakurt achieves initial system access using VPN credentials; it is yet to be known how these credentials are obtained. To achieve persistence, Karakurt uses the VPN IP pool or deploys either Cobalt Strike beacon or AnyDesk remote access tool to establish command and control (C2) communication. Then, the threat actor abuses admin privileges, sometimes by using Mimikatz or PowerShell, and moves laterally in the system. Finally, it uses 7-Zip and WinZip to compress the files stored on the compromised system and exfiltrates them to Mega.io cloud storage using Rclone or FileZilla (SFTP). Karakurt does not encrypt the files, but rather steals them and contacts the victims while threatening to publish or sell them. <br><br>The group has been successful in avoiding common post-exploitation tools or commodity malware, in order to evade detection and bypass security software.    <br><br>Karakurt operated a leak site that was registered in June 2021. The leak site contains several sections: an about page, news about the latest victims and their leaked files, an ‚Äúauction‚Äù section that seems offline, and a ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù page with bogus contact details and a contact form. The group operators also encourage the website users to vote, via the contact form, for the next victims whose files will be uploaded. In addition, the group holds a Twitter account, called ‚ÄúKarakurtLair,‚Äù in which it publishes news about its victims. <br><br>In April 2022, researchers from different cybersecurity vendors established a link between Karakurt and the Conti ransomware group. The researchers gained access to an internal Conti VPS server and discovered that the groups share the same infrastructure and victims. Karakurt also transferred payments from victims to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by Conti. In addition, the researchers penetrated Karakurt's web server for their leak site and found documentation of tools that were used by the group, including the Ligolo-ng tunneling and pivoting tool, the Metasploit post-exploitation tool, Impacket for performing NTLM-relay attacks, and Danted for reverse tunneling.",

            "Overview": "OldGremlin, active since at least March 2020, is a Russian-speaking ransomware group that was discovered by researchers from Group-IB in August 2020. The group was identified targeting Russian enterprise networks with malware and ransomware from multiple industries, including banks, manufacturers, software developers, and medical labs. \nTypically, Russian hackers avoid attacking organizations in Russia and former Soviet countries. The evidence of attacks on Russian enterprises leads security researchers to believe that the group might run test operation campaigns in Russia before targeting worldwide companies.\n\nSecurity researchers assume that OldGremlin is behind ransomware attack strains that were dubbed as TinyCryptor and decr1pt. The OldGremlin group was identified in a successful ransom attack on a Russian clinical laboratory company in August 2020. The attackers, using decr1pt stain, completely encrypted the company‚Äôs corporate network and demanded a ransom of $50,000 for the decryption key. They provided a Proton email address for contact.\nOldGremlin‚Äôs ransomware campaigns are based on sophisticated social engineering skills along with custom backdoors, dubbed as TinyNode, and TinyPosh.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "OldGremlin uses the spear phishing technique to gain initial access to victim environments. The phishing emails impersonate current events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests in Belarus as well as known Russian institutes, such as RosBiznesConsulting (RBC), a major media holding company in Russia. Those phishing email messages include ZIP files, carrying the attacker‚Äôs self-made backdoors, which enables the group to access the victim networks for deploying ransomware.\n\nIn April 2022, Group-IB reported on the resurgence of OldGremlin after more than a year. The threat actors launched two phishing campaigns against Russian organizations. The threat actors impersonated a senior accountant at a Russian financial organization and sent email messages with malicious macro-embedded documents, stored in Dropbox. Once triggered, the macro codes were used to download a new variant of the TinyNode backdoor, dubbed TinyFluff, granting the attackers remote system access. Then, OldGremlin performed reconnaissance to check if the application runs in a test environment and to collect information about the infected system, connected drives, installed plugins, and files that were stored in specific directories on the system drive. At the final stage of the attack, the threat actors deployed the TinyCrypt/TinyCryptor ransomware payload, encrypting files and dropping a ransom note.",

            "Overview": "The Hafnium threat group was first reported by Microsoft in March 2021, attributing the group to several intrusions since January involving several zero-day exploits in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019 (collectively known as ProxyLogon). The threat actors leveraged the zero-day vulnerabilities to primarily target infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs in the United States.<br/><br/>According to Microsoft, Hafnium is a Chinese state-sponsored group. It is a ‚Äúhighly skilled and sophisticated actor,‚Äù and conducts its operations primarily from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States.<br/><br/>The following zero-day vulnerabilities were leveraged by Hafnium to infiltrate the Microsoft Exchange servers:<br/><br/>1. CVE-2021-26855, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange that allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.<br/><br/>2. CVE-2021-26857, an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service that gave the threat actor the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server (this requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit).<br/><br/>3. CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065, two post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerabilities in Exchange that allowed the group to write a file to any path on the server (after authenticating by exploiting CVE-2021-26855 or by compromising a legitimate admin‚Äôs credentials).<br/><br/>4. CVE-2021-26855 is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication of any kind, nor does it require any special knowledge or access to a target environment. ‚ÄúThe attacker only needs to know that the server is running Exchange and the account from which they want to extract email,‚Äù Volexity researchers explained.<br/><br/>After gaining initial access, Hafnium deployed web shells on the compromised servers to steal data and perform additional malicious actions. They were able to download the Exchange offline address book that contained information about the organization and its users.<br/><br/>On March 5, 2021, only three days after Microsoft announced the Hafnium zero-days, security experts reported that the same Chinese cyberespionage group dramatically stepped up attacks on any vulnerable, unpatched Exchange servers worldwide. It was published that at least 30,000 organizations across the United States, including a significant number of small businesses, cities, and local governments were hacked in these attacks that were focused on stealing email contents from victim organizations.<br/><br/>In July 2021, the United States government, the European Union, the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and NATO officially blamed China for backing up the Microsoft Exchange hacking campaign, attributed to Hafnium. They also linked China to other APT groups targeting the West, APT31 and APT40, and pressed charges against four of their alleged members.<br/><br/>In December 2021, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) released a report naming several threat groups, including Hafnium, that exploited the Critical Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) to attack organizations.<br/><br/>In April 2022, Microsoft researchers reported on a new malware that was used by Hafnium to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised Windows systems. The malware, dubbed Tarrask, creates scheduled tasks and hides them from \"schtasks /query\" and Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor registry value. This enables the threat actors to maintain system access even after reboots by restoring dropped connections to their command and control (C2) server. The researchers also observed the use of the Impacket tool for lateral movement.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Recommendations:<br/><br/>The vulnerabilities affect Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. Exchange Online is not affected.<br/>- It is highly recommended to update Exchange Servers that are externally facing. All affected Exchange Servers should be updated.<br/>- It is recommended to restrict any untrusted connections on port 443, and setting up a VPN to separate the Exchange server from external access. <br/>- It is highly recommended to run the Exchange Server Health Checker script. Running this script will tell you if you are behind on your on-premises Exchange Server updates (note that the script does not support Exchange Server 2010). <br/><br/>The security updates can be found here: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2175901.<br/>The Exchange Server Health Checker script can be found here: https://github.com/dpaulson45/HealthChecker#download.",

The encrypted files are appended the .sunnyday extension and a ransom note named ‚Äú!-Recovery_Instructions-!.txt‚Äù is dropped. SunnyDay also deletes volume shadow copies (VSS) and can remove itself at the end of the encryption process. During its execution, the ransomware collects general system information, such as the device name, total RAM, and the number of connected CPUs. This information is grouped in a large string and sent to a remote command and control (C2) server that is assumed to be hosted on Tor.    \n\nSunnyDay shares similarities with other ransomware strains, such as Ever101, Medusa Locker, Curator, and Payment45, however, no solid connection could be established between the different ransomware operators.",

In many cases, the malware‚Äôs .NET executable is hosted on the Discord CDN, indicating that it is also distributed within gaming-related Discord servers. ZingoStealer is primarily designed for Russian speakers and performs geolocation checks to avoid operating on devices of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\n\nWhen deployed, ZingoStealer creates a directory for harvested data and steals sensitive information from web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera, general system information (e.g. IP address, OS version, and computer name), account tokens for installed applications and software (e.g. Telegram and Discord), and cryptocurrency information. \n\nAt the end of the data collection process, all the information is packed in a ZIP file and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server. In addition, the attack logs are processed and published on Haskers Gang‚Äôs Telegram channel so ZingoStealer users can access them. The infostealer can also be used as a loader for other malicious payloads, such as RedLine Stealer and XMRig. A new version of the malware even incorporates an XMRig-based malware, dubbed ZingoMiner, for harvesting Monero.   \n\nAs noted above, the malware is available for free, however, Haskers Gang also offered a paid version for 300 rubles (around $3), which includes a crypter named ‚ÄúExoCrypt‚Äù for better antivirus evasion, and its source code was made available for $500.",

            "Overview": "BotenaGo is a botnet that was first observed by AT&T researchers in November 2021. The botnet targets various types of routers, modems, NAS, and IoT devices. There is little information about Botena Go's specific targets.\n\nThe botnet, written in Golang, leverages 33 vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2020-9054, CVE-2020-10987, and CVE-2020-8958), some of which are almost 10 years old. Once installed, it can receive commands in either of the following methods: \nThe first is to create two backdoor ports, 31412 and 19412, and listen to the latter port to receive the target‚Äôs IP address. Once a connection to that port is established, it maps the vulnerabilities on the receiving address and exploits them to gain an initial foothold. The second method is to set a listener to system IO (terminal) user input and receive a target to exploit through this terminal. After gaining access, the botnet executes remote shell commands on the compromised devices and uses different payloads to match each infected system.\n\nThe botnet does not seem to have any active communication to a command and control (C2) server, which implies it is only one module in an infection chain and there is another module operating it. In addition, BotenaGo bears some resemblance to the Mirai botnet, so it may be a new tool operated by the same developers on specific tools known to them.\n\nBotenaGo and its variants have very low detection rate by most antivirus vendors.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In January 2022, BotenaGo's source code was made publicly available through GitHub. This might result in new variants of the malware emerging in the near future. \n\nIn April 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new BotenaGo variant targeting Lillin DVR devices. The newly observed variant, dubbed \"Lillin scanner,\" used only one remote code execution exploit, enabling it to elevate its stealthiness. In addition, it seemed to rely on an external mass-scanning tool (e.g. Shodan) to form IP address lists of vulnerable devices to target. The attack chain led to the deployment of Mirai payloads, targeting a wider range of exploits and devices and expanding the infection.      \n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK¬Æ TTPs:\n\nTA0008: Lateral Movement\nT1210: Exploitation of Remote Services\nT1570: Lateral Tool Transfer\nTA0011: Command and Control\nT1571: Non-Standard port",

            "AdditionalInformation": "The Lemon Duck malware can attack both Linux and Windows systems, using two different branches. The Linux branch consists of bash scripts that are executed after the attacker successfully compromises a Linux host using the Redis, YARN, or SSH attack vectors.\nThe Windows branch has at least 12 independent infection vectors. These capabilities range from server message block (SMB) and RDP password brute-forcing, sending emails with exploit attachments, or targeting the RDP BlueKeep flaw (CVE-2019-0708).\n\nAfter the initial infection, a PowerShell loading script is downloaded, which disables Windows Defender‚Äôs real-time detection and puts powershell.exe on the list of processes excluded from scanning. It also checks if the script is running with administrative privileges. If it is, the payload is downloaded and run. If not, it leverages existing system executables to launch the next stage.\n\nThe Lemon Duck modules include the main loader, which checks the level of user privileges and components relevant for mining, such as the type of the available graphic card. If these GPUs are not detected, the loader downloads and runs the commodity XMRig CPU-based mining script. Other modules include a main spreading module, a Python-based module packaged using Pyinstaller, and a killer module designed to disable known competing mining botnets. Lemon Duck also includes an email-spreading module. These emails use a mix of COVID-19-related subject lines and text, as well as other emotion-driven lures.\n\nBetween March 2020 and October 2020, researchers identified activity associated with Lemon Duck affecting three different companies in the government, retail, and technology sectors. \n\nBetween the end of August and October 2020, researchers observed an increase in DNS requests connected with the Lemon Duck command-and-control (C2) and mining servers, in attacks centered on Asia, including ones targeting Iran, Egypt, Philippines, Vietnam, and India.\n\nIn April 2022, Crowdstrike researchers reported on a Lemon Duck campaign targeting exposed Docker APIs on Linux servers to mine cryptocurrency. Once Lemon Duck was deployed, it ran a malicious container to download a Bash script disguised as a PNG image file. Then, it created a cronjob that downloaded a Bash file (a.asp). This file was used to terminate processes of known mining pools and competing cryptomining groups, terminate known daemons   (e.g. crond, sshd and syslog), delete known indicator of compromise (IOC) file paths and C2 network connections of rival cryptomining groups, and disable Alibaba Cloud‚Äôs monitoring service. Next, the Bash file downloaded and executed the XMRig cryptomining tool and attempted to perform lateral movement by searching for SSH keys on the filesystem and using them to repeat the infection chain.",

            "Overview": "The Malsmoke cybercriminal group, first reported by cybersecurity researchers in September 2020, has been active since early 2020. Its name stems from the most frequent payload that it used to distribute, SmokeLoader, although Malsmoke is currently more recognized with the ZLoader malware (AKA Zeus, Zbot). The group spreads malware globally, usually by using malvertising or social engineering methods.\n\nMalsmoke first received attention from the cyber community in a malvertising campaign that took place in 2020. During the campaign, the threat actors used JavaScript code embedded in malicious ads on adult content websites. The code redirected users to malicious sites hosting the Fallout exploit kit that is designed to exploit browser and Flash Player vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2019-0752, CVE-2018-15982) and deploy information stealing malware, such as SmokeLoader and ZLoader. \n\nIn mid-October 2020, the threat actors were observed switching their attack vector into popping fake Java plug-in updates in decoy adult videos. Once the user installed the plug-in, it downloaded a DLL file that executed an encrypted variant of ZLoader. In addition, the malware distribution evolved from infecting all browser users, rather than only ones who use Internet Explorer. Malsmoke was noted for using sophisticated redirection mechanisms that include client-side fingerprinting and connectivity checks to avoid VPNs and proxies, and only targeting legitimate IP addresses.\n\nIn January 2022, Checkpoint researchers reported a new Malsmoke campaign that started around November 2021. The campaign infected more than 2,100 users around the world, primarily from the United States, Canada, and India. The threat actors gained system access through the installation of a legitimate remote management software named ‚ÄúAtera.‚Äù It is unknown how the software installer was distributed to the victims, but it is assumed to be via spear phishing email messages or through downloading pirated software. Atera granted the attackers full system control, enabling them to execute scripts and download malicious files, including Zloader executables that communicate with a remote command and control (C2) server. Other files were used to modify Windows Defender settings and disable other detection and analysis tools, such as task manager. In addition, the DLL file that was used to execute the ZLoader malware carried a valid code signature, so it bypassed Microsoft‚Äôs digital signature verification process and evaded detection. This was an exploitation of known Microsoft signature validation vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1599, CVE-2013-3900, CVE-2012-0151) that were incompletely patched by the company.",

The financially-motivated group targets Eastern European organizations from different sectors, such as telecommunications, electronics, and industrial.  \n\nHive0117 gains initial system access through phishing email messages, impersonating Russian government agencies or other Russian organizations. The messages, written in Russian, contain malicious ZIP attachments with self-extracting installers (SFX) and the DarkWatchman JavaScript RAT that is bundled with a C# keylogger. To evade security mechanisms, DarkWatchman uses a novel fileless persistence method. It utilizes Windows Registry for almost all storage tasks and does not write anything on the disk. In addition, the malware uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to generate a list of command and control (C2) domains, which makes it harder to map the threat actor‚Äôs malicious infrastructure.",

            "Overview": "The Naikon advanced persistent threat (APT) group (AKA Lotus Panda), was initially observed carrying out a large-scale cyber-espionage campaign between 2009 and 2015. The Chinese APT was found to be state-sponsored and belonged to the Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs (PLA) Chengdu Military Region Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (Military Unit Cover Designator 78020). According to MITRE ATT&CK, Naikon shares some characteristics with APT30, however, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches.\n\nNaikon's attacks utilized CVE-2012-0158, via spear-phishing email messages, each of them designed to be of interest to the potential victim. These emails carried attachments that looked like a Word document, but were actually custom malware. The RAT that was used by Naikon featured 48 commands, including instructions for downloading and uploading data, installing add-on modules, or working with the command line.\n\nThe cyber-espionage group targeted government, military, and civil organizations around the South China Sea with these schemes for at least five years. Some of the institutions that were affected by Naikon‚Äôs espionage campaign in the various targeted countries were the Office of the President\nMilitary Forces, Office of the Cabinet Secretary, and the National Security Council.\n\nIn 2018, Naikon developed a set of crafted backdoors called Aria-Body. The backdoors are relatively difficult to detect, as much of the code operates in memory, injected by other loader components without touching the disk.\n\nThese backdoors are capable of persistence handling, file and directory handling, keylogging, shell/process management, system information collection and management, download management, location/IP verification, and network communication over HTTP.\n\nBetween June 2019 and March 2021, Naikon launched a series of attacks against military organizations in Southeast Asia. Naikon introduced two new backdoors dubbed Nebulae and  RainyDay. The latter is similar to another malware called FoundCore by another security firm. In addition, they used five legitimate software tools in the attacks, including Mobile Popup Application, Outlook Item Finder, Sandboxie, VirusScan On-Demand, and ARO, all primarily used for exfiltration purposes.\n\nIn April 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new Naikon cyber campaign targeting an unknown entity that was assumed to be a South Asian government institution. The threat actors sent spear phishing email messages that contained Microsoft Office documents with a malicious macro code. Once the macro was enabled, a loader named HexINI was deployed executing a shellcode that injected a beacon for the Viper penetration tool. Similar to Cobalt Strike, Viper enables easy payload generation, such as Meterpreter, ReverseShell, and other custom beacons, and features over 80 modules that can be used for initial access, establishing persistence, command execution, and more.",

The cyberespionage group partially overlaps with the Chinese-speaking threat groups RedFoxtrot and Nomad Panda. \n\nWhile the exact initial access vector of Moshen Dragon is currently unknown, it involves the abuse of legitimate antivirus software of known vendors, such as Symantec, TrendMicro, BitDefender, McAfee, and Kaspersky, to perform DLL search order hijacking and stealthily sideload malicious DLL files. These DLLs contain malware, such as ShadowPad and PlugX variants (e.g. Talisman). In addition, the threat actors deploy the Impacket tool for performing lateral movement and remote code execution through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Impacket is also used by Moshen Dragon to deploy an LSA notification package to harvest credentials and capture password change events. The group was also observed dropping the GUNTERS loader. GUNTERS first checks if it is executed on the correct machine, and if so, it uses WinDivert to intercept incoming traffic until it gets the string that is required for decrypting and launching the threat actors‚Äô malicious payloads.   \n\nMoshen Dragon is considered to be a highly resourceful group, adapting its tools to the defensive obstacles that it faces.",

It primarily targets activists, journalists, government officials, military entities, politicians, academicians, and lawyers, in various European countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, Germany, and Poland, but was also observed operating in Colombia and Kuwait. \n\nUNC1151 is attributed to the 2017 Ghostwriter disinformation campaign. This campaign consisted of numerous incidents of website compromise and email spoofing that were used to distribute falsified news, documents, and correspondence. The initial goal, which has changed over time, was to spread narratives that object to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization‚Äôs (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe. \n\nIn addition to what was attributed as part of the Ghostwriter campaign, UNC1151 engaged in other operations involving credential stealing and malware distribution, using phishing domains and email messages with malicious attachments. The malware used in these operations include RADIOSTAR, VIDEOKILLER, and HALFSHELL.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In January 2022, the Ukrainian government accused UNC1151 of defacing dozens of government websites as part of the ongoing geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine. The websites displayed a message in Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish, stating that all the data on the computer was destroyed and mentioning some politically disputed Polish and Ukrainian regions.\n\nIn February 2022, The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) warned about a spear phishing campaign that was attributed to UNC1151 targeting Ukrainian armed forces personnel. The attackers compromised the email accounts of their targets and sent phishing messages to their contact list. In addition, Meta (formerly Facebook) announced that it blocked accounts and phishing domains that were used by the group to target Ukrainian officials and military personnel. \n\nOn March 7, 2022, researchers from Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported that UNC1151 actively conducts phishing campaigns against Polish and Ukrainian government and military organizations, while targeting webmail users from the following providers: i.ua, meta.ua, rambler.ru, ukr.net, wp.pl and yandex.ru. In addition, Google blocked phishing domains that were used in these campaigns.\n\nOn March 23, 2022, the CERT-UA reported that UNC1151 deployed Cobalt Strike beacons in the devices of Ukrainian entities, using phishing email messages with macro-embedded documents. \n\nOn March 30, 2022, Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported that UNC1151 used the \"Browser in the Browser\" technique in their phishing campaigns, hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised websites.\n\nIn May 2022, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported on five active threat groups, including UNC1151, targeting organizations and individuals in Eastern Europe. UNC1151 specifically targeted Ukrainian Gmail users with phishing email messages leading to credential harvesting pages. In addition, the group targeted Facebook users, primarily in Lithuania, sending them phishing messages impersonating the Facebook security team.",

            "Overview": "Operation CuckooBees is an ongoing campaign by the Chinese APT group Winnti (AKA APT41, Blackfly, and Barium) since at least 2019. The campaign has been targeting technology and manufacturing companies, primarily in East Asia, Western Europe, and North America. Operation CuckooBees aims to steal intellectual property, including sensitive documents, blueprints, diagrams, formulas, and other proprietary information. In addition, the campaign operators target user accounts and credentials, and customer data.   \n\nWinnti attains initial system access by exploiting different vulnerabilities in ERP platforms, some of which are zero-day flaws. Once infiltrating the system, the threat actors employ various methods to establish persistence, such as installing a JavaScript-based webshell, tampering with the WinRM protocol for remote access, abusing the legitimate Windows services IKEEXT and PrintNotify to sideload DLLs, and loading a signed kernel rootkit. Then, they perform reconnaissance using Windows commands and create scheduled tasks to run batch files and gain system information. In addition, the threat actors attempt to crack user passwords, using different credential dumping techniques. \n\nNext, Winnti creates remote scheduled tasks using the Windows Schtasks command and executes malicious code to move laterally in the system. Finally, the threat actors deploy a Chinese-language version of WinRAR to create password-protected archives, collect stored sensitive information, and exfiltrate it to a remote command and control (C2) server. To evade detection, the WinRAR executable masquerades as a legitimate Windows program rundll32.exe.\n\nIn the course of the campaign, Winnti deployed a new DEPLOYLOG malware loader and new versions of Spyder Loader, PRIVATELOG, and WINNKIT. The group also abused the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) mechanism to conceal the malicious payloads and evade detection by common security software.",

As the malware still seems under development, there is little information about its specific targets.\n\nNetDooka is dropped through the PrivateLoader pay-per-install (PPI) malware distribution service, that is downloaded to the victim‚Äôs computer. PrivateLoader is mostly distributed through pirated software that are promoted to the top of the user‚Äôs search results using SEO poisoning techniques. Once deployed, PrivateLoader first checks that it is not running in a virtual environment and disables antivirus tools on the infected machine. In addition, it deobfuscates strings, such as the command and control (C2) server address. Then, it downloads and executes another dropper component that decrypts the final payload, the NetDooka RAT. On some occasions, the loader installs a driver to act as kernel-mode protection for the RAT to prevent the deletion or termination of its activity. \n\nThe RAT, written in .NET, receives commands via TCP, and can be used to log user keystrokes, collect web browser data, take screenshots, gather general system information, record audio through the device‚Äôs microphone, control the device‚Äôs camera, use the host‚Äôs resources to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, perform remote desktop operations, and more actions.       \n\nIt seems that NetDooka is primarily used to steal user data; however, threat actors might take advantage of its incorporated loader to fetch additional malware strains as part of a broader attack chain.",

The infostealer is loaded into the %TEMP% directory and checks if it runs on a virtual environment or a sandbox. If such an environment is detected, the malware terminates its execution. After this verification, Jester Stealer creates text files to save the stolen data, which is collected from various applications, such as web browsers, VPN clients, password managers, instant messaging apps, email clients, cryptocurrency wallets, and gaming software. Jester Stealer also collects general system information and user credentials, and takes screenshots of the infected system. <br/><br/>The collected information is packed in a ZIP file and exfiltrated via TOR to Telegram bot, or AnonFiles in case of a communication failure.

The RAT was observed targeting entities in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, although its distribution might be wider. \n\nNerbian RAT, written in Golang, is distributed through phishing email messages impersonating legitimate entities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO). The messages contain Microsoft Word documents (sometimes placed inside RAR archives) with malicious macro code. Once the macro is enabled, a BAT file is dropped and performs a PowerShell execution to download a UPX-packed dropper named \"UpdateUAV.exe.\" The dropper reuses code from different GitHub projects, such as Chacal, to perform anti-analysis and anti-detection checks before deploying the RAT. Nerbian can be used to log user keystrokes, take screenshots, and execute arbitrary commands. The collected data is then exfiltrated to a command and control (C2) server over an encrypted SSL protocol.",

The malware spreads globally infecting millions of Android devices.\n\nGriftHorse lurks inside seemingly legitimate applications that can be downloaded from Google Play and other third-party app stores. The malicious apps take many forms, such as utility tools, dating services, and entertainment apps. Once downloaded, the malicious apps start flooding the victims with alerts inviting them to receive a prize. If the prize invitation is accepted, the victims are redirected to geo-specific web pages, based on their IP address, where they are asked to submit their phone numbers for verification. As the malware acquires the victims‚Äô phone numbers, it subscribes them to a premium service with monthly charges without their knowledge or consent.\n\nThe malicious applications are developed using the Apache Cordova framework. This enables the GriftHorse operators to deploy application updates without requiring user interaction. In addition, the threat actors employ different techniques to help the malware stay undetected, such as avoiding hardcoding URLs in the malicious apps, not reusing the same command and control (C2) domains, and encrypting the C2 communications.\n\nIn May 2022, Kaspersky researchers reported on two different variants of GriftHorse: GriftHorse.l that requires an active subscription to some fraudulent service with automatic billing, and GriftHorse.ae that secretly subscribes its victims to an attacker-controlled ‚Äúservice‚Äù by acquiring their phone numbers. The researchers found that both variants were active, primarily in Russia.",

The botnet spreads globally, targeting vulnerable Windows and Linux servers.\n\nSysrv, written in Golang, gains initial system access either by performing brute-force attacks or by exploiting known vulnerabilities that are found in web applications and databases, such as PHPUnit (CVE-2017-9841), Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638), Atlassian Confluence (CVE-2019-3396) and Jira (CVE-2019-11581), and Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2020-14882). Once infiltrating the system and gaining remote access, the botnet operators deploy Monero (XMRig) miners and other malicious scripts that help the botnet to self-propagate. One of the malicious scripts, ldr.sh, attempts to uninstall security software and to terminate the activity of all competing cryptocurrency miners that are discovered on the compromised system, to ensure exclusivity. The botnet also harvests SSH private keys to move laterally in the network, creating more bots and cryptomining infrastructure to increase profits.     \n\nIn May 2022, Microsoft reported a new Sysrv variant, named Sysrv-K, with improved capabilities, such as scanning for vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework (e.g. CVE-2022-22947) and WordPress. This variant can be used to look for WordPress configuration files and their backups to steal database credentials and use them to take over the webserver.",

The malware is used in distributed denial-of-service campaigns against Linux machines, in countries such as the United States, India, Spain, and Italy. Blackberry researchers attribute the malware to the Chinese Winnti Group (AKA APT41). \n\nXorDDoS, acting as a botnet with an embedded LKM rootkit component, gains initial system access either by performing SSH brute-force attacks or by exploiting known vulnerabilities that are found in Linux environments, such as ARM (IoT) or x64 servers. The malware‚Äôs main executable is an ELF binary, written in C/C++, that once deployed, communicates with a remote command and control (C2) server using XOR-based encryption. To maintain persistence, it also copies itself multiple times inside the compromised machine. Then, it can be used to initiate different types of DDoS attacks, such as SYN flood, ACK flood, and DNS amplification. Furthermore, it can receive additional commands from the C2 server to download and execute other malicious payloads, such as the Tsunami backdoor, which leads to the deployment of the XMRig cryptominer. XorDDoS features various obfuscation and security evasion mechanisms and it employs anti-forensic techniques to prevent system analysis.",

Space Pirates targets government, aerospace, IT, and electric power organizations in Russia, Georgia, and Mongolia. It was also observed targeting Chinese companies in the financial sector. \n\nSpace Pirates usually gains initial system access through spear phishing messages containing decoy documents and an SFX archive. The latter embeds an EXE file using DLL side-loading to execute the MyKLoadClient loader for malware distribution. Sometimes the EXE file hides inside a PDF document and acts as a dropper for the malicious payloads. The group was observed distributing various types of malware, such as a variant of PcShare, the Zupdax and ShadowPad backdoors, the PlugX and Poison Ivy RATs, and the custom BH_A006 backdoor. The latter is a modified version of the Gh0st backdoor, featuring many obfuscation and security evasion mechanisms. In addition, Space Pirates uses a custom Trojan, called Deed RAT, that supports different protocols for command and control (C2) communications (e.g. TCP, HTTP, UDP, and DNS). This Trojan can collect system information, update the shellcode for an injection that is stored in the registry, and deactivate the C2 connection. In addition, the malware can remove itself from the system. \n\nSpace Pirates was observed lingering in the compromised systems for a long time (about a year), infecting numerous servers and harvesting sensitive data for the purposes of espionage and financial gains.",

            "Overview": "Snake Keylogger (AKA 404 Keylogger) is an information stealing malware that was first reported in November 2019, and initially released on a Russian hacking forum in August 2019. It is mostly used in malspam campaigns set against various entities around the world. The malware is named after strings found in its log files and obfuscation code.\n\nThe Snake Keylogger is written in .NET and primarily spreads through phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to drop sites. However, it was also observed to spread in encrypted Telegram messages. Once the payload is executed, it creates a copy with a randomized name in the victim‚Äôs AppData folder. This generated copy runs as a scheduled task to achieve persistence on the network. Before the exfiltration process, the malware searches for general system information, such as the operating system version, IP addresses, and geolocation. In case the IP address or geolocation matches a blocklist of addresses, the malware does not proceed to the credential harvesting stage. \nThen, Snake sets a keyboard connection to log the victim‚Äôs keystrokes and parallelly continues to search for saved credentials in over 50 supported applications, such as web browsers (e.g. Chrome and Firefox), email management apps (e.g. Microsoft Outlook), and social media and instant messaging platforms (e.g. Discord). In addition, it can take screenshots of the infected system. All of the exfiltrated data is stored in a folder and sent to the threat actor either via email messages, FTP or SMTP servers, Pastebin sites, or an HTTP POST request in a dedicated telegram channel. In order to avoid detection, it terminates all the associated processes running on the network, including security programs.\n\nThe infostealer was created by an Iraqi developer, nicknamed on online forums as Razer, aka Brwa, Brwa65, HiDDen PerSOn, and 404 Coder. Its code bears many similarities to the Matiex malware‚Äôs code, suggesting a possible connection between their developers. The malware is sold on dark web forums for a price ranging from 25 to 500 dollars, depending on the selected configuration and services. The operators of the malware are allowed independence in choosing the malware features that will be activated upon deployment, and may reduce the use of some features in order to stay hidden on their targets‚Äô networks.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In July 2021, the Snake keylogger was reported as one of the malicious tools utilized in a global phishing campaign, targeting large international companies in the energy, oil & gas, and electronics industries. It was found in malicious attachments sent by email used to obtain sensitive information, log keyboard strokes and steal browsing data.\n\nIn May 2022, HP Wolf Security researchers reported that Snake was observed to be distributed through phishing email messages with PDF attachments. The PDF files led to the download of malicious RTF documents with malformed OLE objects. They abused a known Microsoft Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to run arbitrary code and deploy the Snake keylogger.",

            "Overview": "The Predator spyware was first reported by Citizen Lab researchers in December 2021. The malware was created by the commercial surveillance developer, Cytrox, based in North Macedonia. Predator was observed targeting Android and iOS mobile devices of people of interest, such as politicians and journalists, in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Serbia, and Indonesia. Sometimes, this malware is deployed along with other spyware like NSO‚Äôs Pegasus.\n\nPredator is distributed through phishing links, impersonating legitimate services, that are sent to the victims via email messages or instant messaging platforms (e.g. Whatsapp). Once clicked, the malicious link redirects the victims to an attacker-controlled domain, deploying exploits for various zero-day vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2021-38000 in Chrome and CVE-2021-1048 in Android), before redirecting their browser to a legitimate website. The exploits enable the background installation of malware loaders, such as the Alien Android banking Trojan or a Python-based loader, that fetch and execute Predator. The malware can be used to record audio, add CA certificates, and hide certain applications to evade detection.",

            "Overview": "The Twisted Panda cyberespionage campaign, first reported by Check Point researchers in May 2022, was active from at least June 2021 through April 2022. Twisted Panda was likely conducted by an unnamed Chinese threat actor with connections to other Chinese APT groups, Stone Panda (AKA APT 10, Cicada) and Mustang Panda (AKA Bronze President, HoneyMyte). The campaign intensified following the Russo-Ukrainian War and targeted Russian and Belarusian defense research institutes.\n\nIn the course of the campaign, the threat actors used spear phishing email messages that contained decoy Microsoft Word documents with malicious macro codes. Once the macro was enabled, it dropped a 32-bit DLL loader using name hashing for evasion and anti-analysis purposes. The loader created a scheduled task to establish persistence and executed a second-stage multi-layered loader to inject the final payload into memory. The injected payload was a previously undocumented backdoor, dubbed Spinner, that used two compiler-level obfuscations and collected system information, such as the victim‚Äôs IP address, computer name, username, and OS version. Then, Spinner generated a random 8-byte RC4 key to encrypt the information packet and send it to a remote command and control (C2) server over HTTP/S. Furthermore, the backdoor could be used to run arbitrary commands and fetch additional malicious payloads from the C2 server.\n\nAlthough the attribution of this campaign to Chinese threat actors is not definite, its targets are consistent with China‚Äôs long-term interests to become a world technological leader.",

            "Overview": "The BPFdoor malware (AKA JustForFun), first reported by cybersecurity researchers in May 2022, has been active since at least 2017. The backdoor targets Linux and Solaris systems of organizations from various sectors, such as telecommunications, government, logistics, and education, in countries such as the United States, South Korea, Turkey, India, and Vietnam. BPFdoor is named after its use of a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) sniffer that enables it to see all network traffic. \n\nBPFdoor is a passive backdoor, as it listens on one or more ports for incoming packets from the host and enables its operators to remotely send commands to the compromised network. The backdoor is unique in its ability to monitor any port for ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets, even if these ports are used by other legitimate services, such as web servers, FTP, or SSH. The malware operators do not need to open any new network ports to perform remote code execution and they use a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù password to control the malware‚Äôs actions. To gain root-level permissions and establish persistence, the threat actors were observed leveraging a vulnerability in the XScreenSaver component of the Solaris operating system (CVE-2019-3010) and using SysVinit scripts.  \n\nBPFdoor is considered to be a very stealthy malware and cannot be stopped by firewalls. To evade detection, the malware renames its binary to one of 10 random names masquerading as a normal Linux daemon. The malware also changes the binary‚Äôs date and deletes it after it starts running, to make it more difficult for system analysis tools.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) researchers attributed BPFDoor to a Chinese threat actor dubbed Red Menshen. They found that the threat actors used Virtual Private Servers (VPS), administered via compromised routers in Taiwan, to send commands to the BPFDoor on infected devices.\n\nCrowdstrike attributed the malware to a threat actor that they track as DecisiveArchitect.",

The threat actors primarily target organizations in the high tech, higher education, and manufacturing sectors around the world. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been observed targeting organizations leading national responses to Coronavirus, in sectors such as government, healthcare, insurance, medical research and publishing, and utility. The targeted organizations were located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, and Australia. \n\nSilverTerrier usually distributes its malware via BEC attacks, in which compromised email accounts are used to spread phishing messages, impersonating a company's executives or vendors. Sometimes the email messages impersonate other legitimate organizations, such as shipping, banking, or law enforcement agencies. The email messages contain various types of information stealing malware, such as Agent Tesla, AzoRult, LokiBot, and Zeus, or RATs, such as DarkComet, NanoCore, Remcos, and WSHRat. These are used to steal sensitive information and user credentials and to exfiltrate the data to a remote command and control (C2) server. In addition, the email messages contain lures exhorting the recipients to transfer money to the threat actors‚Äô bank accounts. \n\nAccording to law enforcement organizations, over the years, SilverTerrier caused business losses estimated at more than three billion dollars.\n\nOther malware used by SilverTerrier: Predator Pain, Pony, KeyBase, ISpySoftware, ISR Stealer, Atmos, LuminosityLink, NjRat, Quasar, WarZone, Netwire, ImminentMonitor, Adwind, Hworm, Formbook, Renals, and Revenge.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In January 2022, it was reported that Interpol and the Nigerian Police arrested 11 individuals suspected to engage in global BEC scams. Some of which were believed to be part of SilverTerrier. The law enforcement operation codenamed \"Falcon II,\" was conducted between December 13 and 22, 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, the Nigeria Police Force arrested Murtala Mohammed, the alleged leader of SilverTerrier. The Nigerian national was arrested as part of \"Operation Delilah,\" a year-long investigation that involved Interpol and several cybersecurity companies, such as Palo Alto Networks.

            "Overview": "The EnemyBot malware was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in March 2022. The botnet, based on the Gafgyt and Mirai source codes, spreads globally, initiating cryptomining and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against modems, routers, IoT devices, and desktop/server architectures such as BSD (e.g. Darwin and x64). It is operated by a threat actor nicknamed Keksec (AKA Kek Security, Necro, and FreakOut) who has been linked to other botnets, such as Simps, Ryuk (not to be confused with the ransomware), and Samael.  \n\nThe EnemyBot operators gain initial system access either by performing brute-force attacks or by exploiting known vulnerabilities, such as in Seowon Intech routers (CVE-2020-17456), D-Link DWR routers (CVE-2018-10823), and iRZ mobile routers (CVE-2022-27226). Once deployed, the botnet connects to a command and control (C2) server and waits for commands to execute. EnemyBot supports various commands, such as performing different kinds of DDoS attacks (e.g. TCP, UDP, and HTTP), spreading to other devices using SSH/Telnet brute-forcing and exploits, running shell commands, and updating the download server for exploit payload. Some of the commands may indicate that the botnet is used in extortion campaigns. \n\nTo mask its presence in the system, EnemyBot uses different obfuscation techniques; its C2 domain uses XOR encoding with a multi-byte key and is only accessible through Tor, credentials that are used for SSH brute-forcing use Mirai-style encoding (single-byte XOR encoding with 0x22), and commands are encrypted with a substitution cipher.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In May 2022, AT&T Alien Labs observed new EnemyBot variants that were designed to exploit 24 different vulnerabilities, including newly discovered flaws in VMware products (CVE-2022-22954), the Spring framework (CVE-2022-22947), and F5 BIG-IP (CVE-2022-1388). The new variants were also found to support the creation of a reverse shell on the infected system, enabling threat actors to bypass firewalls. The security vendor recommended the following mitigation measures:\n1. Maintain minimal exposure to the Internet on Linux servers and IoT devices and use a properly configured firewall.\n2. Enable automatic updates to ensure your software has the latest security updates.\n3. Monitor network traffic, outbound port scans, and unreasonable bandwidth usage.",

The malware was used in numerous campaigns around the world, targeting various sectors such as information technology, enterprise services, hospitality, and transportation. AsyncRAT shares code and behavior similarities with RevengeRAT, and some consider them to be the same malware. A December 2020 report by JPCERT/CC claimed that AsyncRAT was partially copied from the Quasar malware family. \n\nAsyncRAT, written in C#, was originally created for educational purposes (available on GitHub) and was designed to remotely monitor computers through secure connections. Nevertheless, it was soon adapted for malicious purposes by different threat actors employing its diverse capabilities to log user keystrokes, record audio/video, steal user credentials and other sensitive information, remotely control users‚Äô desktops, capture screens, and upload additional malware. The RAT usually spreads through phishing, malvertising, and watering hole attacks, sometimes as part of exploit kits.\n\nAsyncRAT has been used in different cyber campaigns, including:\n- Operation Comando - a phishing campaign that was initiated at the end of 2018, primarily targeting the Brazilian hospitality sector. The campaign operators sent phishing email messages with macro-embedded documents, distributing the CapturaTela Trojan and different types of RATs, such as AsyncRAT, LimeRAT, and NanoCoreRAT.\n- Operation Spalax - a 2020 cyberespionage campaign targeting Colombian entities, using phishing email messages with malicious RAR archives. The threat actors infected their victims with RATs, such as AsyncRAT, Remcos, and njRAT.  \n- A 2020 Sidewinder campaign, in which the threat actors used spear phishing email messages to deliver modified versions of AsyncRAT.  \n- Operation Layover - a series of malicious campaigns, reported in September 2021, targeting the aviation industry using AsyncRAT and njRAT.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In January 2022, Morphisec researchers reported a phishing campaign distributing AsyncRAT. The campaign, believed to be initiated in September 2021, included the sending of email messages with decoy HTML attachments. Once the users opened the attachments, they were redirected to an attacker-controlled domain exhorting them to save an ISO file, leading to the eventual deployment of AsyncRAT. To evade detection, the ISO file was not generated from a remote server, but from within the victim's browser using an embedded JavaScript code. \n\nOn April 5, 2022, Cisco Talos researchers reported that they observed a series of phishing campaigns distributing AsyncRAT and LimeRAT. The campaign operators used a new version of the 3LOSH crypter to obfuscate the RAT payloads.  \n\nOn April 27, 2022, AsyncRAT was observed being distributed through a spoofed website of Thailand Pass. The decoy website pretended to issue travel documents to Thailand, but actually infected users with the malware.",

            "Overview": "The GoodWill ransomware group was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in March 2022 and reported in May 2022. The group is assumed to be based in India, as some of its infrastructure sits on Indian IP addresses and the ransomware strain contains strings in Hinglish (a mixture of Hindi and English). The GoodWill operator motivations are unique, as they claim to extort victims to help the poor, rather than for personal financial gains. There is little information about the group‚Äôs specific attack vector and victimology.\n\nWhen deployed, the .NET-based ransomware, packed with UPX, encrypts the files that are stored upon the compromised machine using the AES algorithm and then sleeps for 722.45 seconds to interfere with dynamic analysis. In addition, GoodWill drops a multiple-paged ransom note that requires the victims to fulfill three social tasks in order to obtain the decryption key. The tasks include donating new clothes to the homeless, taking five less-fortunate children to Dominos, Pizza Hut, or KFC for a treat, and providing financial assistance to anyone who needs urgent medical attention but cannot afford it. The victims need to record their activities by taking screenshots and selfies and posting them on their social media accounts.\n\nOnce the three tasks are completed, the victims should write a note on social media explaining ‚ÄúHow you transformed yourself into a kind human being by becoming a victim of a ransomware called GoodWill‚Äù and send the threat actors links of documentation in exchange for a full decryption kit (the decryption key, a password file, and a tutorial).   \n\nThe GoodWill ransomware strain is based on the HiddenTear open-source ransomware that was developed by a Turkish programmer back in 2015.",

            "Overview": "ERMAC is an Android banking Trojan that was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in July 2021. The malware was initially targeting only users in Poland, but its distribution seems to be expanding with time, as it was observed infecting users from other countries as well, such as the United States. ERMAC is considered to be a descendant of the BlackRock banking Trojan, both developed by a threat actor nicknamed ‚ÄúDukeEugene.‚Äù\n\nERMAC infects users by masquerading as legitimate Android applications, such as banking, government, media players, delivery services, and antivirus solutions (e.g. McAfee). Like other banking malware, ERMAC abuses Android's Accessibility Service and is capable of stealing contact information and text messages, recording audio, opening applications, obtaining financial data, and triggering overlay attacks to steal credentials. In addition, it has some unique features, like clearing the cache of a specified application and stealing the device‚Äôs accounts list. \n\nERMAC‚Äôs code is almost fully based on the Cerberus banking Trojan, whose code was put for sale on hacking forums in August 2020. However, ERMAC is different in its obfuscation techniques and the Blowfish encryption algorithm that it uses for command and control (C2) communications.\n\nIn November 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported on several Android campaigns that took place between August and November 2021, resulting in more than 300,000 infections of Android banking Trojans in the Google Play Store. ERMAC was one of the banking Trojans that were used by Brunhilda dropper operators, to compromise mobile devices and steal valuable information.\n\nIn May 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new version of ERMAC (2.0) increasing the number of targeted applications from 378 to 467. This version had been made available on underground hacking forums for $5,000 per month.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Among the companies whose applications were targeted by ERMAC: Uber, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Netflix, Wells Fargo, HSBC Australia, Akbank, Barclays, BBVA, Kutxabank, and Capital One.",

            "Overview": "The Formbook information stealing malware was first observed in February 2016 after it was put on sale on various underground hacking forums by a user nicknamed ‚Äúng-coder.‚Äù The malware‚Äôs name stems from its form-grabbing capabilities which enable it to steal user credentials before they reach a secure server, thus bypassing HTTPS encryption. It was initially attacking Windows users from dedicated sectors, such as aerospace, defense, and manufacturing, in the United States and South Korea, but over the years spread to many other countries and sectors. At the end of 2020, it was ranked by CheckPoint as the third-most popular malware used by threat actors, accounting for 4% of the compromised organizations. In February 2020, Formbook was rebranded as ‚ÄúXLoader‚Äù and was reworked to operate on macOS systems in addition to Windows.<br/><br/>Threat actors distribute Formbook primarily via malspam campaigns, while at the same time leveraging various remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2017-11882, and CVE-2021-40444. The spam email messages may contain PDF files with download links, Microsoft Office files (e.g. DOC or XLS) with malicious macros, or archive files (e.g. ZIP or RAR) with EXE payloads. Once installed, Formbook can log user keystrokes, monitor clipboard data, take screenshots, steal user credentials from web browsers and email clients, and execute additional commands it receives from a command and control (C2) server, such as reboot and shutdown the system, clear browser cookies, and download and execute files. All the acquired data is then exfiltrated to a remote C2 server.<br/><br/>The malware is able to evade security mechanisms, such as antivirus software and sandboxes by using sophisticated obfuscation methods. In addition, it offers a PHP panel, where threat actors can track their victims' information, including screenshots, keylogged data, and stolen credentials.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In March 2020, Formbook was one of many malware that was spread using COVID-19 lures. The malware operators sent spam email messages, masquerading as updates from the World Health Organization (WHO). The decoy messages included ZIP attachments with malicious executables, triggering GuLoader that downloaded the Formbook malware.<br/><br/>In May 2020, cybersecurity researchers reported that the RATicate threat group used the legitimate Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) to create Windows installers, deploying various malware, such as LokiBot, Agent Tesla, and Formbook. The group targeted industrial firms in Europe, the Middle East, and South Korea, using malspam email messages.<br/><br/>In December 2021, threat actors bypassed a previously fixed remote code execution vulnerability affecting Microsoft‚Äôs MSHTML component (CVE-2021-40444) to deliver Formbook. The attackers used a ‚ÄúCAB-less 40444‚Äù exploit, which bypassed Microsoft‚Äôs fix by enclosing a malicious Word document in a custom RAR archive. The file was sent in spam email messages, and included a JavaScript code that launched a WSH script and an embedded PowerShell command to deploy the Formbook malware.<br/><br/>In May 2022, Check Point researchers reported a new XLoader version that obfuscates its C2 servers to evade detection. The malware was observed to overwrite eight C2 domains with new values in every communication attempt, disguising the real C2 servers. <br/><br/><br/>Disclaimer: on the IOCs section are detailed domains and IP addresses that security researchers related to Formbook's activity. Most of them seem suspicious, but they are not verified to have malicious intentions. We advise you to use these IOCs with caution and verify them before adding them to your block-list. Among these domains may be legitimate domains, which will cause false-positive on your organization‚Äôs network.",

            "Overview": "Flubot is an Android (Google, Huawei, and Samsung devices) banking malware that was discovered by PRODAFT, a cyber intelligence and security company, on November 10, 2020. The malware was dubbed Flubot due to its ability to rapidly spread with infection vectors that resemble the common flu, but it is also named \"Cabassous\" and \"FedEx Banker\" by several other security researchers.\n\nThe malware's main purpose is to steal user credentials, credit card details, and collect private information from the victim‚Äôs infected device. The FluBot massive spam campaign was first identified targeting Spain, but based on malware analysis reports of several FluBot versions (3.6, 3,7, 3,8, 4.0) conducted by security researchers, the malware is also targeting various countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, and also in different languages (a Japanese version was detected). FluBot will probably keep spreading globally, with the United States a likely next target.\n\nA FluBot campaign usually starts with a text message sent to a potential victim‚Äôs mobile phone disguised as a delivery service company (DHL, FedEx, Correos, but also companies such as Asda, Amazon, and Argos). Then, by using different message themes, the victim is asked to click on the attached link in order to track package delivery. When the victim clicks on the link, he will be redirected to a compromised website, encouraging the victim to download a malicious app containing FluBot malware embedded and encrypted within the APK files. \n\nOnce installed, the user will be required to provide the malware permissions via the Android Accessibility service and Notification, authorizing the malware to use: Internet access, reading/sending SMS, reading the phone book, performing calls, deleting an application, ability to use accessibility service, read notifications, access protected accounts and more. Additionally, the malware is exporting the victim‚Äôs contact list to a remote C&C server which later will be used for spamming and spreading again by sending a text message. The Flubot blocks all incoming notifications and intercepts SMS messages to prevent its detection. Once the Flubot detects a target application launch, the malware starts an overlay attack, downloading fake login pages webview-based on various famous banks and other applications sending the data to a remote C&C server.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Based on the PRODAFT report, FluBot has already infected more than 60,000 devices, with 97% of the victims located in Spain. Another report related to Flubot malware and conducted by Proofpoint, revealed that the English-language campaign used more than 700 unique domains, infecting about 7,000 devices in the UK.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, four hackers were arrested by the Catalan police in Barcelona, and suspected of being behind a massive criminal scheme, associated with the Flubot malware campaign. Among the group members arrested, one of them was in charge of the malware technical side by writing the malicious code and creating the fake bank login pages.\n\nIn October 2021, the New Zealand CERT team published a warning on fake security updates utilized by threat actors to infect users with Flubot. The security notifications alerted the victims that their device was infected by Flubot, enticing them to install an update that in fact delivered the malware.    \n\nAt the end of November 2021, Finland's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-FI) issued an alert warning against an Android smishing campaign, distributing the Flubot malware. The SMS messages contained links to compromised websites, from which malicious APK installers were downloaded and deployed Flubot. This campaign added up to another large Flubot malspam campaign in 2021, targeting Finnish users and spamming thousands of them between June and August.\n\nIn January 2022, Flubot was reported to be distributed as part of a widespread smishing campaign. The SMS messages exhorted victims to upload some video via a link. Once the victims clicked on the link, they were directed to a page from which they could download a fake Flash Player APK deploying the Flubot malware. The malware was updated three times since December 2021, adding more functionalities, such as a domain generation algorithm (DGA) that uses 30 top-level domains instead of just three in earlier versions, and a C2 connection via DNS tunneling over HTTPS, rather than a direct HTTPS port 443.\n\nIn the same month, cybersecurity researchers reported on a similar Flubot campaign targeting users from Australia and various European countries, such as Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, and the Netherlands. Since the beginning of December 2021, the researchers identified over 100,000 phishing messages trying to distribute Flubot. The messages that were distributed either via SMS or through Facebook messenger, included fake courier messages, and fake software update notifications. In addition, Flubot operators continue with \"Is this you in the video\" scams, in which this message is allegedly sent from an individual that appears on the device's contact list. The message contains a link leading the victim to a credential harvesting page, or to an installation notification of a fake Flash player or other Android components that in fact deliver Flubot.\n\nIn February 2022, Flubot was observed spreading via smishing messages alongside the Medusa Android banking Trojan. The malware demonstrated a new functionality to abuse the ‚ÄúNotification Direct Reply‚Äù feature, enabling it to directly reply to push notifications from targeted applications on the victim‚Äôs device. This might lead to bypassing two-factor authentication, signing fraudulent transactions on the victim's behalf, and replying to social application notifications with malicious phishing links.\n\nIn June 2022, Europol announced the takedown of the Flubot operation. During the takedown operation that involved 10 countries, including Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States, the Spanish police arrested four suspects for allegedly taking part in the Flubot operation, and the Dutch police disconnected 10,000 victims from the Flubot network and prevented more than 6.5 million spam SMS from reaching their destinations. Europol stated that the FluBot infrastructure was seized by law enforcement and thus could not be reinstated.",

It is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) that is sold by a Russian-speaking threat actor, nicknamed ‚ÄúMa1n,‚Äù for 250 dollars a month. Prometheus TDS was used in global campaigns targeting organizations from various sectors, such as government, finance, retail, energy, and healthcare, in countries such as the United States and Belgium. \n\nPrometheus TDS is used to redirect users to phishing or malware-hosting websites, delivering various malware, such as Campo Loader, IcedID, QBot, SocGholish, Hancitor, and Buer Loader. These usually lead to the deployment of secondary payloads like ransomware. \n\nService subscribers can use an administration panel to choose their targets (based on preset conditions, such as geographical location, web browser, or operating system) and upload a list of compromised web servers. Then, Prometheus TDS scans the list and delivers its own malware, a PHP-based backdoor named ‚ÄúPrometheus,‚Äù to the targeted servers. The backdoor collects user data, such as IP address, user agent, time zone, and language, and sends it back to the attacker. Based on the received data, the attacker can decide whether to send spam email messages with direct links or documents with links that lead the victim to malicious URLs used to download malware or harvest credentials. In some cases, once the malware was downloaded, the malicious documents redirected users to legitimate websites (e.g. DocuSign and USPS) as a way to mask the infection. \n\nThe developers of Prometheus TDS based their developments on the cracked and leaked copies of Cobalt Strike, and also created other malicious software, such as the BRChecker brute-forcing tool.",

The Chinese APT group primarily targets technology, media, defense, telecommunications, education, and foreign diplomatic organizations in China and its surroundings, with occasional infections in other regions, such as Europe and North America. \n\nLuoYu, named after a Chinese mythological creature, originally used watering hole attacks to deliver its malware, but in 2020 switched to man-on-the-side attacks leveraging the automatic update mechanism of select legitimate applications. Man-on-the-side attacks are considered to be very dangerous and destructive, as they do not require any direct interaction with the target, only that the user device be connected to the internet. \n\nThe threat actors monitor their targets' network traffic for update requests of popular Asian apps, such as QQ, WeChat, and WangWang, and replace them with malicious installers. These installers deploy various information stealing malware, such as WinDealer, ReverseWindow (AKA Demsty), and SpyDealer. The deployed malware can harvest general system information (e.g. hostname, username, OS version, CPU information, and IP address), install backdoors to maintain persistence, manipulate files, take screenshots, scan for other devices on the network, and run arbitrary commands. To establish command and control (C2) connection, LuoYu‚Äôs malware do not use hardcoded C2 information, but rather connect to a random ChinaNet (AS4134) IP address out of a pool of 48,000 IP addresses.   \n\nLuoYu is considered to be a very sophisticated threat actor, employing advanced attack vectors and able to infect various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android).",

The threat actors might also extract credentials for AWS and Docker systems from compromised servers and use them as part of their infection cycle. Once infiltrating the system, WatchDog deploys its three-part binary set and a Bash or PowerShell script file. The deployed toolset is used to remove cloud security tools and previously installed and cryptomining software, and then to prepare the ground for the download of the XMRig miner. Using previously obtained root privileges, WatchDog drops XMRig and adds a systemd service unit for persistence. Then, the threat actors deploy another payload incorporating ZGrab, Masscan, and pnscan, to search the network for valid pivoting points before dropping the final two scripts that are used for propagation.    \n\nMost of WatchDog‚Äôs scripts include logos and references to the TeamTNT group, suggesting that WatchDog may be stealing the tools from its rival.",

As the malware is still under development, there is little information about its specific targets.\n\nSVCReady usually spreads through phishing email messages with malicious macro-embedded documents. Unlike the common practice of distributing malicious payloads through VBA macros, the SVCReady operators use VBA to run shellcode hiding in the file properties. This enables the threat actors to bypass security software and conceal their malware. Different shellcode is loaded depending on if the system architecture is 32 or 64-bit. Once executed via SetTimer API, a DLL file is dropped into the %TEMP% directory and uses a copy of rundll32.exe as a downloader for SVCReady. \n\nThe malware establishes a connection to a command and control (C2) server and starts collecting general system information (e.g. username, computer name, and timezone) through Registry queries and Windows API calls. The collected information is packed in a JSON format and exfiltrated to the C2 server through HTTP POST using RC4 encryption. After the exfiltration process, the malware creates a scheduled task and a new registry key to achieve persistence, and then begins another exfiltration process of OS information, including taking screenshots. In some cases, SVCReady loads additional malware, such as RedLine stealer. To evade analysis, the malware makes two WMI queries to check if it runs in a virtual environment and it sleeps for 30 minutes.     \n\nSecurity researchers that investigated SVCReady found that it uses similar infrastructure (e.g. lure images and resource URLs) as TA551 (AKA Shatak), indicating a possible link between the malware and the threat actors.

The Chinese APT group primarily targets government, education, and telecommunication organizations in Southeast Asia and Australia. Aoqin Dragon is assumed to be a small cyberespionage group, potentially associated with UNC94 and the Chinese APT group, Naikon (AKA Lotus Panda). \n\nAoqin Dragon‚Äôs attack vector has evolved over the years. Until 2015, the group used weaponized Word documents exploiting known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333. To exhort their victims into opening the malicious documents and infect themselves with backdoors, the threat actors used lures involving APAC political affairs and pornographic topics. Later on, Aoqin Dragon started using fake antivirus executables acting as droppers to execute backdoors and establish a command and control (C2) connection. From 2018, the threat group turned to fake removable-disk shortcut files acting as malware loaders, to exhort victims into clicking the wrong folder. Once clicked, the files execute a malicious process, named \"Evernote Tray Application,\" and perform DLL hijacking to load an encrypted backdoor. If the loader detects any connected removable devices, the payload is copied to infect other devices in the network. \n\nAoqin Dragon uses two different backdoors, Mongall (HJ-client.dll) and a modified version of Heyoka. The first is equipped with an encryption protocol and Themida packer to protect against reverse engineering and can be used to exfiltrate data about the victim‚Äôs machine, create remote shells, and upload and download files. The second backdoor uses spoofed DNS requests to establish a bidirectional communication tunnel, and can create and delete processes, files, and folders, and collect information about the host.

            "Overview": "The Hexane threat group (AKA Lyceum) targets organizations in the oil and gas industry and attacks telecommunication providers in Africa, the greater Middle East and Central Asia. The Iranian group started its operations around mid-2018 and its activity accelerated in early- to mid-2019.\n\nThe threat actors attack third-party service providers to compromise their victims. The malicious activity could be made through a trusted vendor, bypassing much of the entity‚Äôs security stack. Hexane's intrusion activity includes the sending of malicious documents that drop malware to gain an initial foothold for further activities.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "At the beginning of May 2021, ClearSky researchers detected a new espionage campaign related to Hexane, dubbed Siamesekitten, targeting an Israeli IT company. The threat actors established a large infrastructure that enabled them to impersonate the Israeli company and its HR personnel. This campaign is similar to the North Korean ‚ÄúJob seekers‚Äù campaign, employing impersonation techniques. This attack vector was used in past campaigns, such as the Dream Job campaign conducted by Lazarus in 2020 and the 2021 campaign of the Iranian group OilRig (AKA APT34) targeting Middle Eastern victims.\n\nIn July 2021, ClearSky researchers detected a second wave of similar attacks against additional companies in Israel. In this campaign, Hexane upgraded a new backdoor variant called ‚ÄúShark‚Äù to replace the older version ‚ÄúMilan.‚Äù  \n\nThe full report with the malware analysis can be found here: https://www.clearskysec.com/siamesekitten/\n\nAt the end of March 2022, Check Point Research (CPR) published a report detailing three APT groups, including Hexane, that took advantage of the Russo-Ukrainian War to compromise organizations. The group used war-related lures to deliver macro-embedded documents or decoy PDF files to Israeli and Saudi Arabian entities. These were used to deploy various malware: a .NET DNS backdoor that can download and upload files and execute commands; a .NET TCP backdoor that can execute commands, take screenshots, upload and download files, and list files, directories, and applications; and a Golang HTTP backdoor that can upload and download files and execute shell commands. Hexane was also observed to use security evasion techniques, such as DNS tunneling for command and control (C2) communications.\n\nIn June 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported that Lyceum started using a .NET-based DNS backdoor, a customized version of the open-source tool ‚ÄúDIG.net.‚Äù The threat actors sent their victims phishing messages with macro-embedded Word documents. Once enabled, the macro code dropped the DNS backdoor onto the Startup folder. The malware was used to perform DNS hijacking, manipulating DNS queries to execute commands remotely, exfiltrate data, and upload and download files from the C2 server using the DNS protocol.

This Linux malware primarily targets the financial sector in Latin America. Symbiote is named after its parasitic nature, living in symbiosis with other system components and using its resources, while remaining undetected.   \n\nUnlike most malware, Symbiote is not delivered as an executable, but rather as a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into running processes using LD_PRELOAD. It hooks the \"libc\" and \"libpcap\" functions to hide its presence, injects itself into the inspection software's process and uses the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) feature to filter out network traffic results that would uncover its activity. Once infecting all running processes, Symbiote provides its operators with rootkit functionality, harvests credentials by hooking the ‚Äúlibc read‚Äù function and exfiltrates them via DNS requests, and grants remote system access through Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) functions. To better undermine its victims, Symbiote uses domains that impersonate legitimate entities such as major Brazilian banks and the Federal Police of Brazil.  ",

The ongoing campaign targets approximately 10,000 users a day, primarily located in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and France.\n\nThe FakeCrack operators use the Black SEO technique, abusing search engine indexing mechanisms to elevate the position of malicious websites in the victims‚Äô search results. Most of the websites exhort the victims to download cracked versions of legitimate software, such as the Windows optimization program, CCleaner Pro. The websites contain a link that, once clicked, redirects the user through several websites, eventually leading to a landing page offering to download a ZIP file. To avoid suspicion, the landing pages are hosted on legitimate file hosting platforms, such as filesend.jp or mediafire.com. The ZIP file is usually protected by a weak password (e.g. 1234) that is sufficient for preventing it from being analyzed by antivirus software. \n\nThe ZIP file contains a single executable that, once installed, scans the user‚Äôs computer, collects system information, takes screenshots, and steals web browser data, such as account passwords, saved credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. All the harvested information is packed in an encrypted ZIP file and exfiltrated to a remote command and control (C2) server. In addition, the malicious executable drops two more files (AutoIt compiler and script) that scan the clipboard for copied wallet addresses and replace them with ones that are controlled by the attackers. The malware also uses proxies to steal credentials and other sensitive data from cryptocurrency marketplaces using a man-in-the-middle technique, setting up an IP address and downloading a malicious Proxy Auto-Configuration script (PAC). Every time the victim accesses any of the listed domains, the traffic is redirected to a proxy server under the threat actor‚Äôs control.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "If one‚Äôs system has been compromised, Avast recommends checking the proxy settings and removing malicious ones by employing the following steps:\n- Remove the AutoConfigURL registry key in the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\n\nAlternatively, using GUI:\n- Click Start.\n- Type Settings and press enter.\n- Go to Network & Internet > Proxy.\n- Delete Script Address and click Save.\n- Disable the ‚ÄúUse a proxy server‚Äù option.",

There is little information about HelloXD's specific targets. \n\nWhile HelloXD‚Äôs initial access vector was not disclosed, its operators were observed deploying an open-source backdoor named MicroBackdoor, embedded within the ransomware payload. This backdoor enabled them to browse through the file system, upload and download files, execute commands, and then remove itself at the end of the process. Once executed, HelloXD attempts to delete volume shadow copies and encrypts files that are stored on the compromised machine, appending them with the .hello extension. In addition, a ransom note named Hello.txt is dropped, containing a Tox Chat address to communicate with the attackers and what seems like an extortion onion site, currently offline (might be under development). Newer HelloXD variants also change the desktop background to display a picture of a ghost. HelloXD‚Äôs binaries are packed using two main methods, a modified UPX packer and a custom packer with two layers of obfuscation.  ",

            "Overview": "The RobbinHood ransomware group (sometimes written as RobinHood) was first observed in April 2019. The group targets organizations from various sectors, such as government, energy, and insurance, in countries like the United States and India. \n\nThe malware spreads through hacked remote desktop services. Once infiltrating the system, RobbinHood deploys its Golang-based ransomware strain, encrypts files with the RSA+AES cryptographical combination, and changes their name to Encrypted_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.enc_robbinhood (in some cases the files are appended with the .rbhd extension). The ransomware uses the * /DELETE /Y command to disconnect all network shares from the victim's computer and is deployed to each machine individually, probably through a domain controller or PsExec. Finally, it drops a ransom note with instructions on how to make contact to initiate negotiations. The ransomware‚Äôs main_CoolMaker function contains sub-functions that were designed to disable and disrupt the victim‚Äôs PC backups and services (e.g. antivirus software and mail servers).   \n\nIn April 2019, Robbinhood ransomware hit several electric power companies in India, taking down their websites and making them inaccessible to utility customers. The ransomware encrypted the companies‚Äô servers, however, the companies stated they had backups. \n\nAlso that month, the City of Greenville, NC was hit by the ransomware group.\n\nIn May 2019, RobbinHood attacked the City of Baltimore, MD. The ransomware note on the victims‚Äô system demanded payment of three bitcoins per system or 13 bitcoins (around $80,000) in exchange for decrypting all the systems. The attack was estimated to cause losses amounting to $18 million. At first, it was assumed that the threat actors gained initial access by exploiting EternalBlue/BlueKeep vulnerabilities, but this assumption was later ruled out. During the attack on Baltimore, the Twitter account @Robihkjn (or \"Robbinhood\") was communicating threats to the victims and offered to provide evidence that they could decrypt the locked files if the ransom is paid. The account has since been suspended.\n\nIn October 2019, RobbinHood changed its ransom note and asked the victims to search for incidents reporting on the group's impact. Apparently, this act was made to make sure the victims know that there is no decryption tool and it is very difficult to recover the files without paying the ransom.\n\nIn February 2020, Sophos researchers observed that RobbinHood exploited the CORE-2018-0007 vulnerability in the GIGABYTE driver (CVE-2018-19320) to install a malicious and unsigned driver into Windows in order to disable antivirus and other security software. This was done by deploying an executable named Steel.exe that extracted another file (ROBNR), disabling Windows driver signature enforcement. \n\nIn June 2022, it was revealed that RobbinHood attacked Toyota Motor three months earlier, causing disruptions in all 14 Toyota factories. The attack seemed to start from the automobile parts manufacturer \"Kojima Industries,\" which found the infection on February 26, 2022, shutting down its ordering system. This was the first reported RobbinHood attack in Japan.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "The group used to operate a data leak site: robinhoodleaks.tumblr.com, which currently seems offline.\n\nAmong RobbinHood's past victims: the City of Baltimore, MD, the City of Greenville, NC, Besson Seguros, ABE Courtage, and Maad McCann.\n\nBitcoin addresses that were used by RobbinHood: \n14yos7dpe4bx3imnoGVUcMsNBwU1hLutfj \n132wg6kkJJ4MpNKnuhVoptYPmYHf6C5xHE",

            "AdditionalInformation": "On May 30, 2022, Microsoft published mitigation measures for Follina exploits, including the disabling of the MSDT URL protocol on Windows machines by performing the following steps:\n- Run Command Prompt as Administrator.\n- To back up the registry key, execute the command \"reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt ms-msdt.reg\"\n- Execute the command \"reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt /f\"\n\nThe full Microsoft guidance document can be found here: https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/ \n\nOn May 31, 2022, Proofpoint researchers reported that the Follina vulnerability was exploited in the wild by the Chinese APT group, TA413. The threat actors initiated a phishing campaign against the Tibetan community, in which they sent email messages containing ZIP archives with Word documents. Once the documents were opened or previewed by the victims, the vulnerability was exploited to execute malicious code via the MSDT protocol.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, an unofficial patch for the vulnerability was published on the 0patch blog. The patch concerned the following Windows versions: Windows 11 v21H2, Windows 10 (from v1803 to v21H2), Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Full details can be found here: https://blog.0patch.com/2022/06/\n\nOn June 6, 2022, Proofpoint reported that it blocked an apparent state-sponsored phishing campaign targeting European and US government organizations, while leveraging the Follina vulnerability. The threat actors sent their victims malicious RTF documents concerning some salary increase, to lure them into opening the documents and infect their systems with a Powershell-based infostealer.\n\nOn June 7, 2022, the TA570 threat group was observed to leverage the Follina vulnerability to deliver the Qbot malware (AKA Qakbot). The threat actors used hijacked email messages to send malicious HTML attachments leading to the download of ZIP archives. These contained IMG files with Qbot DLL payloads and shortcut files to execute them. \n\nOn June 10, 2022, Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) issued a warning against active exploitation of the Follina vulnerability, as part of phishing campaigns targeting media organizations in Ukraine. The phishing campaign was attributed with a medium level of confidence to the Sandworm Team (AKA Quedagh, Voodoo Bear) and was aimed to distribute the CrescentImp malware.   \n\nOn June 14, 2022, the Follina vulnerability was patched by Microsoft, as part of its monthly cumulative Windows Updates.",

            "Overview": "The Hydra banking Trojan is an Android-based malware, which was first used around 2018-2019, first as a dropper and then as an Android bankbot. At the beginning of its life, the malware users targeted exclusively Turkish banks and crypto wallet applications; however, since early 2020, the targets expanded to major banks around the globe (e.g., ING Australia Banking, AXA Banque France, Deutsche Bank Mobile, Wells Fargo Mobile, and many more).\n\nLike other banking Trojans, Hydra can screencast - mirroring the victim‚Äôs device screen back to the threat actor in real-time - as well as perform other remote features, such as remote installation and screen locking. It is unique in that it also has a back-connect proxy option that enables the threat actor to impersonate the compromised device in order to perform fraud.\n\nAt the end of September 2021, a new Hydra campaign was discovered by MalwareHunterTeam and analyzed by a cybersecurity research team. This new campaign targeted European e-banking platforms, particularly Commerzbank, the second-largest financial institution in Germany. Banking platform users were infected with a malicious Android package (APK) called ‚ÄúCommerzbank Security,‚Äù which mimicked the official bank application. The new malware version incorporates TeamViewer functionality, which abuses various permissions, most notably accessibility permissions (‚ÄúBIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE‚Äù) and another crucial permission (‚ÄúBIND_DEVICE_ADMIN‚Äù) that allows it to obtain admin privileges. The enabled permissions allow the threat actor to perform different malicious activities, such as spreading SMSs to the victim‚Äôs contact list, stealing user credentials (e.g. passwords and PINs), and modifying the infected device‚Äôs settings. In addition, the new version uses encrypted TOR communication, which disables the Android security feature, Play Protect, and makes it harder to detect.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In November 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported on several Android campaigns that took place between August and November 2021, resulting in more than 300,000 infections of Android banking Trojans in the Google Play Store. Hydra was one of the banking Trojans that were used by the Brunhilda dropper operators to compromise mobile devices and steal valuable information.\n\nIn June 2022, Hydra was observed to be distributed through a downloader masquerading as a PDF document manager app that was promoted on phishing websites. The app has gained more than 10,000 downloads since April and was still available for download two months later. \n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Techniques\n\nT1406 - Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1444 - Masquerade as Legitimate Application\nT1523 - Evade Analysis Environment\nT1412 - Capture SMS Messages\nT1409 - Access Stored Application Data\nT1421 - System Network Connections Discovery\nT1418 - Application Discovery\nT1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery\nT1424 - Process Discovery\nT1507 - Network Information Discovery\nT1412 - Capture SMS Messages\nT1432 - Access Contact List\nT1513 - Screen Capture\nT1571 - Non-Standard Port\nT1573 - Encrypted Channel\nT1090 - Proxy\nT1090.003 - Multi-hop Proxy\nT1447 - Delete Device Data\nT1448 - Carrier Billing Fraud",

            "Overview": "The Blue Mockingbird threat group has been active since at least December 2019. Blue Mockingbird attacks public-facing servers running ASP.NET apps that use the Telerik framework for their user interface (UI) component.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In May 2020, Blue Mockingbird infected thousands of enterprise systems with cryptocurrency-mining malware. The threat actors exploited the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability to plant a web shell on the attacked servers. Then, they used a version of the Juicy Potato technique to gain admin-level access and modify server settings to obtain (re)boot persistence. Once infiltrating the system, Blue Mockingbird downloaded and installed a version of XMRRig, a popular cryptocurrency mining app for the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.\n\nSecurity researchers said that in case the public-facing IIS servers were connected to a company's internal network, the group also attempted to spread internally via weakly-secured RDP or SMB connections.\n\nIn June 2022, Sophos researchers reported that threat actors resembling Blue Mockingbird were observed leveraging vulnerabilities in Telerik UI to install Cobalt Strike beacons and XMRig. The threat actors obtained the Telerik UI encryption keys and then compiled a malicious DLL to be executed during deserialization and ran it within the context of the \"w3wp.exe\" process. They established persistence through Active Directory Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and used them to create scheduled tasks to be run together with a Base64-encoded PowerShell. Then, the attackers used AMSI-bypassing techniques to evade detection and deployed their malware.",

The websites embed Trojanized applications of crypto wallets that once downloaded by the victims, plant backdoors onto their devices. On iOS, the websites also abuse provisioning profiles to side-load the malicious applications on the device to bypass security mechanisms. \n\nThe malicious apps contain a code that collects seed phrases of Web3 wallets (Coinbase, MetaMask, TokenPocket, and imToken) and exfiltrates them to remote domains that mimic those of legitimate vendors. This enables the attackers to access victims‚Äô crypto assets and steal them. Some of the classes that are used in the exfiltration process are obfuscated and encrypted using base64 encoding and RSA cryptography.       \n\nSeaFlower‚Äôs operators are considered to be technically sophisticated‚Äîimplementing advanced code functionality in backdoors and relying on infrastructure that does not overlap with other threat groups or cyber operations.",

            "Overview": "The QNAPCrypt ransomware group (AKA eCh0raix) was first observed in 2019. This ransomware, written in GO language, initially targeted Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices from Taiwanese companies QNAP Systems and Synology. The devices were compromised by brute-forcing weak credentials and exploiting known vulnerabilities to encrypt files found in the system.\n\nQNAP is a vendor selling NAS servers, which the malware operators intended to infect and encrypt its files for ransom. NAS servers normally store large amounts of important data and files, which make them a valuable target for attackers.\n\nIn July 2019, Intezer researchers detected the use of this ransomware against Linux-based NAS and shut them down.\n\nIn September 2019, Intezer researchers attributed this ransomware to a new Russian cybercrime group that operates from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, dubbed ‚ÄúFullofDeep.‚Äù\nMost ransomware groups work in a similar way, which is encrypting all files and delivering a ransom note. However, the QNAPCrypt ransomware demonstrated a few\nimportant differences:\n\n1. The ransom note was included solely as a text file, without any message appearing on the screen.\n2. Every victim was provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet. This method could help the attackers avoid being traced.\n3. Once the victims were compromised, the malware requested a wallet address and a public RSA key from the command and control server (C&C) before file encryption.\n\nFollowing these events, QNAP published a statement in which they strongly recommended updating QTS and Photo Station to their latest versions, in order to keep the user device safe from ransomware attacks and unauthorized usage.\n\nIn June 2020, there was a surge of QNAPCrypt attacks targeting QNAP NAS devices. The threat actors leveraged three vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-19943, CVE-2018-19949, and CVE-2018-19953) that enabled them to install the ransomware strain on vulnerable devices.\n\nIn March 2021, Intezer researchers found a connection between the QNAPCrypt and the SunCrypt malware. They suggested that both malware families share identical code logic for the file encryption, which was likely compiled from the same source code.\n\nIn May 2021, QNAP warned its customers that the QNAPCrypt actively exploited a Roon Server zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-28810 and CVE-2021-28811), enabling the attackers to execute remote arbitrary commands on vulnerable QNAP NAS devices and install ransomware.\n\nIn August 2021, Palo Alto researchers reported on a new QNAPCrypt variant that exploited a critical vulnerability (CVE-2021-28799) to provide its operators remote access to QNAP and Synology NAS devices. This vulnerability was previously exploited to deploy the Qlocker ransomware. The researchers estimated that there are approximately 250,000 vulnerable devices that could manifest as potential targets. \n\nIn December 2021, it was reported that the QNAPCrypt group increased its activity a week before Christmas, taking control of QNAP NAS devices and encrypting files, while leveraging admin privileges. The threat actors demanded a ransom payment ranging between 1200 and 3000 dollars.\n\nIn June 2022, cybersecurity researchers detected a new QNAPCrypt campaign targeting QNAP NAS devices. Details regarding the attack vector of the new campaign were not disclosed; however, new samples were published and are available in the IOC section of this cyber term.  ",

The threat actors install webshell backdoors to enable remote code execution (RCE), and then conceal their traffic by accessing these installed webshells through requests to the legitimate file \"login.jsp.\" To maintain persistence, DriftingCloud creates VPN user accounts and associate certificate pairs on the firewall. The group members write and execute the \"pre_install.sh\" file that runs a malicious command to download a binary, which is later deleted from the disk. \n\nOnce infiltrating the system, the threat actors modify DNS responses for specific websites that are controlled by the victim organization to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting user credentials and session cookies from administrative access to the websites' content management system (CMS). DriftingCloud then leverages the stolen credentials to access the websites‚Äô admin panel and installs the File Manager plugin to upload, download, delete, or edit files. Finally, the threat actors deploy open-source malware, including PupyRAT, Pantegana, and Sliver, that can be used to remotely execute malicious activity.  ",

            "Overview": "The Panchan botnet, first reported by cybersecurity researchers in June 2022, has been active since March 2022. The peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet, likely operated by Japanese threat actors, primarily targets Linux servers of Asian organizations in the telecommunications and education sectors. It was also observed targeting organizations in Europe, North America, and South America.\n\nPanchan, written in Golang, gains initial system access using stolen SSH keys (also used for lateral movement) or an existing list of usernames and passwords to perform brute-force attacks. To conceal its presence, the botnet creates a hidden folder and uses SFTP to copy itself there under the name ‚Äúxinetd.‚Äù Panchan then executes its binary on the compromised machine and initiates an HTTPS POST request to a Discord webhook (probably for victim monitoring). Finally, the botnet establishes command and control (C2) communication over TCP port 1919 and deploys Base64-encoded cryptominer binaries of XMRig and nbhash as memory-based files, to be executed directly from memory, without any disk presence. Panchan also features an anti-monitor mechanism that shuts down all other running cryptomining processes and an anti-kill system that detects Linux termination signals (e.g. SIGTERM) and ignores them. In addition, to avoid detection and establish persistence, the botnet copies itself to /bin/systemd-worker and creates a seemingly legitimate systemd service with the same name.\n\nPanchan has an embedded ‚Äúgodmode‚Äù admin panel that can be used to change the mining configuration and monitor the infection status. The admin panel is written in Japanese, which may hint at the origin of its developers. While analyzing the admin panel, security researchers found a link to a Discord server, probably used by Panchan‚Äôs operators.    ",

In addition, it can steal multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes and bypass MFA authentication, take screenshots, intercept and send SMS messages, intercept calls, read notifications, delete applications, and trigger overlay attacks by abusing Android‚Äôs Accessibility Services.    \n\nMailBot‚Äôs C2 infrastructure was found to be located in Russia and has been used in various smishing campaigns since June 2020. It was also used to distribute the Sality malware (a modified version of SOVA), which may hint at similar developers of both MailBot and Sality.",

            "Overview": "The Cerber ransomware has been sold as a service in the Russian underground black market since February 2016. Its distribution model is based on an affiliate program, in which users share their income with the malware‚Äôs author, \"crbr,\" for its usage.<br/><br/>Cerber uses 4 different crypters, and implements unique features such as the voice message which plays upon encryption of the victim‚Äôs files. Cerber is constantly undergoing developments by its author and was implemented a polymorphic-hash feature for avoiding detection by antivirus solutions. The ransomware commonly spreads using the Rig, Neutrino and Magnitude exploit kits. <br/><br/>Cerber does not infect users from Russia and CIS countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine).  <br/><br/>In October 2016, researchers discovered new variants of Cerber that could shut down database connections to increase infection impact. That new feature only worked from privileged accounts, and it was therefore recommended to limit user privileges to the minimum that is required.<br/><br/>At the end of March 2017, it was reported that the Cerber Ransomware gained the ability to recognize virtual machines, and avoid the detection of anti-viruses and other cyber security tools.<br/><br/>The ransomware disappeared at the end of 2019, but reappeared in December 2021, under the name Cerber2021 (AKA CerberImposter), targeting organizations around the world, while leveraging remote code execution vulnerabilities in Atlassian Confluence and GitLab servers. The ransomware operators used the vulnerabilities to gain initial system access, before encrypting the victims' files, appending them with the .locked extension, and dropping ransom notes named __$$RECOVERY_README$$__.html. The reported ransom demands ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 dollars. This reincarnated version of Cerber has a different code than the older version and is assumed to be operated by a new threat actor who adopted the ransomware's name, ransom note, and Tor payment site. In addition, the new version has a Linux variant, which the older version did not have.<br/><br/>Cerber2021 supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish.",

            "Overview": "BRATA, a Brazilian-developed Android banking Trojan, was first reported by Kaspersky researchers in August 2019, and has been active since January 2019. The malware was initially targeting only users in Brazil, but its distribution seems to be expanding with time, as it was observed infecting users in other countries, such as the United States, Spain, and Italy. The name BRATA is an abbreviation for ‚ÄúBrazilian RAT Android.‚Äù \n\nBRATA usually spreads either by using SMS or WhatsApp messages that are sent to the victims, enticing them to download a seemingly legitimate application or update, or via push notifications on compromised websites. Sometimes the messages and notifications contain links to phishing pages, mostly of banking apps, asking the victims to enter their credentials. The malware operators even disguised it as a CVE-2019-3568 vulnerability patch for WhatsApp, which registered over 10,000 downloads. \n\nOnce installed, BRATA asks for Accessibility Service permissions, abusing them to capture the device‚Äôs screen, record keystrokes, and modify the device settings. In addition, it connects to a command and control (C2) server to exfiltrate user data, including instant messages, location, browsing history, and credentials, especially for banking apps which enables the malware operators to perform fraudulent transactions. The malware is also capable of disabling the Google Play Store functionality, and as a result Google Play Protect.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In January 2022, cybersecurity researchers discovered an evolved version of BRATA which includes new functionalities, such as the ability to use multiple communication channels (HTTP and TCP). In addition, BRATA can now actively detect and remove antivirus apps installed on the infected device, and can delete itself once the bank fraud has been completed or if it is installed on a virtual environment. The new BRATA version was observed in attacks against users from the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Spain, China, and Latin America.\n\nIn June 2022, it was reported that a new BRATA version (BRATA.A) was observed targeting banking applications in Europe. This version was added a new phishing technique, used to harvest user credentials through decoy login pages of the targeted banks. In addition, the new BRATA version was designed to ask for more permissions, enabling it to get the device's geolocation, intercept and send SMS messages, and perform overlay attacks. Once deployed, BRATA.A fetched a ZIP archive from the C2 server containing a JAR file named \"unrar.jar,\" responsible for monitoring events that were generated from installed applications. Security researchers assumed that it might be a preemptive step before abusing Android's Accessibility Service. In addition, the security researchers discovered another malicious module, connected to BRATA's C2 infrastructure, that was only designed to steal short text messages. This module was found targeting the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain.",

Later, the group was also observed distributing malicious loaders through Telegram. ToddyCat uses two previously undocumented malware, the Samurai backdoor and the Ninja Trojan. These obfuscated malware enable the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate files, take control of the infected machines, and move laterally in the network while remaining undetected. \n\nToddyCat‚Äôs victims overlap with multiple Chinese-speaking threat groups, such as the ones distributing the FunnyDream backdoor, which may indicate ToddyCat‚Äôs origin; however, this is not sufficient evidence to link ToddyCat to other previously observed threat actors. In addition, ToddyCat‚Äôs focus on governmental and military entities might imply geopolitical interests and potential state sponsorship.  ",

            "Overview": "The AvosLocker ransomware group emerged in late June and early July 2021 (although according to the group's Tor website, the first announcement was on Jan 1, 2021). One of the ransomware operators, ‚ÄúAvos,‚Äù posted on two major Russian cybercrime forums that he is seeking partners with specific requirements and skills (pentesters/access brokers). The ransomware operators announced on \"dread\" (A dark web discussion forum) that they are willing to collaborate through an affiliate program, offering their ransom as a service (RaaS) model with handling the negotiation, extortion, and the leak publication.\n\nAvosLocker, written in C++, uses strong encryption algorithms (AES-256 and RSA) to encrypt the generated AES keys. Once the encryption process is done, the file extension changes to .avos or .avos2, and a ransom note with instructions \"GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt‚Äù is created on the victims‚Äô machine. AvosLocker targets the following file extensions upon infection: \nndoc docx xls xlsx ppt pptx pst ost msg eml vsd vsdx txt csv rtf wks wk1 pdf dwg onetoc2 snt jpeg jpg docb docm dot dotm dotx xlsm xlsb xlw xlt xlm xlc xltx xltm pptm pot pps ppsm ppsx ppam potx potm edb hwp 602 sxi sti sldx sldm sldm vdi vmdk vmx gpg aes ARC PAQ bz2 tbk bak tar tgz gz 7z rar zip backup iso vcd bmp png gif raw cgm tif tiff nef psd ai svg djvu m4u m3u mid wma flv 3g2 mkv 3gp mp4 mov avi asf mpeg vob mpg wmv fla swf wav mp3 sh class jar java rb asp php jsp brd sch dch dip pl vb vbs ps1 bat cmd js asm h pas cpp c cs suo sln ldf mdf ibd myi myd frm odb dbf db mdb accdb sql sqlitedb sqlite3 asc lay6 lay mml sxm otg odg uop std sxd otp odp wb2 slk dif stc sxc ots ods 3dm max 3ds uot stw sxw ott odt pem p12 csr crt key pfx der dat.\n\nAvosLocker has a dedicated Tor leak website, where its operators publish the stolen data of victims who have not responded or refused to pay the ransom demand. The group usually accepts payments in Monero (XMR), but also accepts Bitcoin for a 10-25% premium. Based on the AvosLocker website, the first leak was on July 13, 2021, and the companies that were hit by the ransomware were from the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Belgium, Germany, Turkey, Spain, and Lebanon.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In October 2021, AvosLocker claimed to breach the tech company Gigabyte INC, leaking 14.9 MB of data in the form of an archive file. The allegedly stolen data included user credentials, HR agreements with personal employee details, information about job candidates, business agreements, and more.\n\nIn December 2021, AvosLocker was observed to improve its attack vector by disabling endpoint security solutions that interfere with the encryption process. The threat actors do so by rebooting the compromised systems into Windows Safe Mode using Windows batch scripts that modify or delete the Registry keys of specific security mechanisms, such as Windows Defender and Kaspersky, and execute a reboot command. \n\nLater that month, the AvosLocker operators released a free decryptor after accidentally encrypting the data of an American police department. The threat actors stated that they do not have a target policy, but usually tend to avoid attacking government agencies and hospitals. \n\nIn January 2022, it was reported that AvosLocker started to use a Linux variant to attack VMware ESXi virtual machines. This variant terminates all ESXi machines on the compromised server, appending the .avoslinux extension to all encrypted files.\n\nIn March 2022, the FBI issued an advisory warning against AvosLocker and stating that the group and its affiliates attacked multiple organizations from critical infrastructure sectors in the United States. The law enforcement agency detailed the group's main TTPs including the use of double extortion, and even triple extortion while threatening to execute distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks during negotiations in addition to leaking the stolen victim data. In some cases, the AvosLocker operators call their victims over the phone, instructing them about the negotiations procedure and threatening them to pay. Furthermore, the FBI mentioned specific vulnerabilities that were likely used by AvosLocker for initial access, and listed tools that were used by the group, including Cobalt Strike, Rclone, PuTTY, AnyDesk, WinLister, and PowerShell scripts. For achieving system persistence, the threat actors usually modify Windows Registry \"Run\" keys and use scheduled tasks. \n\nThe following mitigation measures were proposed on the advisory:\n- Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). \n- Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited interruption to the organization.  \n- Regularly back up data, password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides.  \n- Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time detection.  \n- Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released.  \n- Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts.  \n- Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with the least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.  \n- Disable unused ports.  \n- Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.  \n- Disable hyperlinks in received emails.  \n- Use multifactor authentication where possible.  \n- Use strong passwords and regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts, implementing the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes. Avoid reusing passwords for multiple accounts.  \n- Require administrator credentials to install software.  \n- Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a VPN.  \n- Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams). \n\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220318.pdf\n\nIn May 2022, Trend Micro researchers reported on a new AvosLocker variant that uses a legitimate Avast Anti-Rootkit Driver file (asWarPot.sys) to disable antivirus solutions. In addition, this variant can be used to scan multiple endpoints for the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) using the Nmap NSE script. The researchers observed this variant in an attack, in which the threat actors leveraged a remote code execution flaw in Zoho's ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus software (perhaps CVE-2021-40539) to run an HTML application (HTA) from a remote C2 server. The HTA executed an obfuscated PowerShell script that downloaded an ASPX webshell and an installer for the AnyDeskMSI remote desktop software. AnyDeskMSI was used to deploy additional tools, such as Netscan for network scanning, Mimikatz and Impacket for credential dumping and lateral movement, and the previously mentioned Nmap and asWarPot.sys. In addition, the AnyDeskMSI fetched a mass deployment tool called PDQ to deliver a malicious batch script with various capabilities, such as disabling Windows Update, Windows Defender, and Windows Error Recovery, preventing safeboot execution of security products, and setting the ground for the execution of the AvosLocker executable.\n\nIn June 2022, AvosLocker was among the ransomware groups that were observed exploiting Atlassian Confluence's OGNL injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-26134) to take over unpatched servers. The threat actors were found to compromise systems in different parts of the world, including the United States, Europe (e.g. Czech Republic, Romania, and Portugal), and Australia.\n\nIn addition, Cisco Talos researchers reported that AvosLocker was engaged in a month-long campaign in February. The threat actors leveraged the Apache Log4j vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon Unified Access Gateways (UAG) to gain initial system access and execute malicious code remotely. Then, AvosLocker used living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) to establish persistence and perform lateral movement while deploying malware and hacking tools, such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver, and Mimikatz. The group's ransomware strain was deployed using a legitimate software deployment tool called PDQ Deploy.",

            "Overview": "Tropic Trooper (AKA Earth Centaur, KeyBoy, Pirate Panda) is a Chinese state-sponsored APT group that has been active since at least 2011. It is known for targeting Southeast Asian institutions, mainly from Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. <br/><br/>The group's most significant attack was in March 2018, known as the \"Operation Tropic Trooper.\" This operation targeted institutions in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the healthcare, government, and industrial sectors. The threat actors implemented spyware in their victims' networks for three years. <br/><br/>The group‚Äôs weapons are not only their own equipment, such as the Yohaoyah malware, but also known malware in the cyber world, such as the Poison Ivy RAT. There are also indications that they have used a PC Share malware family. <br/><br/>Tropic Trooper is known to be very professional, as they perform a thorough background check on their targets before they attack. Their phishing campaigns are well crafted and manage to trick many victims into installing malware on their devices. In addition, the group is proficient at bypassing security mechanisms and lingering in the system undetected for long periods of time.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In December 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported that Tropic Trooper reemerged in July 2020 after a certain halt, under the name Earth Centaur, targeting organizations in the transportation industry and government agencies related to transport. The group was observed to gain access via vulnerable Internet Information Services (IIS) or Microsoft Exchange servers, installing web shells. Then, it deployed first stage loaders (e.g. Nerapack and Quasar RAT), and second stage backdoors, such as ChiserClient and SmileSvr, and customized versions of Gh0st RAT and Lilith RAT. The latter was used to collect sensitive data that was then exfiltrated to cloud storage providers using Rclone. In addition, the threat actors deployed other post-exploitation tools, such as SharpHound, for network discovery, and legitimate tools, such as ProcDump.exe, that were used for credential dumping. In order to hide their activities, they used a customized wiper that deleted specified event logs.<br/><br/>In June 2022, Check Point researchers observed a new campaign that was attributed with a high level of confidence to Tropic Tropper. The threat actors deployed a previously undocumented loader called \"Nimbda,\" written in Nim, that was bundled with SMS Bomber, a greyware tool commonly used for denial of service (DoS) attacks against phones. In addition, the loader injected shellcode into a notepad.exe process to connect with an attacker-controlled GitHub or Gitee repository and fetch an obfuscated executable of the Yahoyah Trojan. The Trojan, encrypted with a modified AES cipher (AEES), was used to collect and exfiltrate general information about the host (e.g. OS version, installed antivirus products, and MAC address). The final dropped payload was identified as the TClient backdoor that was frequently used in past Tropic Tropper campaigns.   ",

            "Overview": "The Hermit mobile spyware, first reported by cybersecurity researchers in June 2022, has been active since at least 2019. The spyware was observed targeting entities in Italy, Syria, and Kazakhstan, although the target distribution might be broader. It is believed that Hermit was developed by the Italian spyware vendor, RCS Lab S.p.A, and a telecommunication company called Tykelab Srl, suspected to be operating as a front company. \n\nHermit is usually distributed through SMS messages that contain a link to download seemingly legitimate applications from companies, such as WhatsApp, Samsung, Vivo, and Oppo. It is assumed that in some cases, the malware operators work with the targets‚Äô ISP to disable their mobile data connectivity. Then, the threat actors send them malicious SMS messages exhorting them to install an application to recover their data connectivity. Hermit infects both iOS and Android devices. On iOS, the malware, signed with an enterprise certificate, is sideloaded to victims‚Äô devices. This malware version contains different built-in exploits, enabling it to escalate privileges on the compromised devices and exfiltrate sensitive files. On Android, Hermit does not use embedded exploits; it asks the victims to enable the installation of apps from unknown sources and uses the DexClassLoader API to fetch and execute remote modules communicating with the main app. In addition, upon installation, the malware requests many permissions through the manifest file.\n\nLike other mobile spyware, Hermit can obtain the device‚Äôs contact list, call logs, GPS location, SMS messages, and stored photos. In addition, it can gain root privileges, abuse the Accessibility Services, record audio, and make and redirect phone calls.\n\nHermit‚Äôs developers, RCS Lab, are vendors of so-called ‚Äúlawful intercept‚Äù spyware, similar to NSO Group‚Äôs Pegasus and Gamma Group‚Äôs FinFisher. Although its developed spyware may be used for legitimate purposes, such as law enforcement, it might also be easily abused for unlawful citizen tracking. As such, the company was linked to providing surveillance tools to military and intelligence agencies of authoritarian regimes, such as in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan.       ",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In 2019, Hermit was used by the Italian authorities in an anti-corruption operation. In addition, the malware was used to spy on Kurdish people living in northern Syria, and in April 2022, it targeted Kazakh citizens, in a campaign that was possibly initiated by the government.",

            "Overview": "The DarkCrystal RAT malware (AKA DCRat) has been active since 2018. The RAT is sold on Russian hacking forums for a very low price of 500 RUB (around $5) for a two-month license and 4,200 RUB (around $40) for a lifetime subscription. This low price makes it extremely prevalent in cybercampaigns and consistently ranked among the top 10 malware threats of ANY.RUN. \n\nDarkCrystal RAT was developed by Russian-speaking threat actors, nicknamed \"boldenis44\" and \"crystalcoder,\" and –ö–æ–¥–µ—Ä (‚ÄúCoder‚Äù). The malware, written in .NET, is commonly distributed through phishing email messages with macro-embedded documents and via drive-by downloads from compromised websites hosting the malware. It is usually deployed with the help of additional tools, such as Cobalt Strike beacons and the Prometheus traffic direction system (TDS).\n\nOnce deployed, DarkCrystal RAT can collect web browser data (e.g. cookies and saved passwords), take screenshots, log user keystrokes, collect clipboard data, steal user credentials and access tokens from Steam, Telegram, Discord, and FileZilla, gather general system information, access the infected device‚Äôs camera and microphone, initialize UDP/TCP flood attacks, manage files, and execute remote commands. In addition, affiliates can expand the malware‚Äôs functionalities by developing their own plugins using a dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) called DCRat Studio. The DarkCrystal RAT‚Äôs developers also used JPHP to create an administration tool, enabling the malware operators to sign into active command and control (C2) servers, execute commands, submit bug reports, and terminate the malware‚Äôs process.   \n\nThere is an active Telegram channel called ‚ÄúDarkCrystal RAT [NEWS]‚Äù with thousands of subscribers, in which the malware developers share information about added features and plugin updates.  ",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In October 2021, Cisco Talos researchers reported a phishing campaign targeting Afghanistan and India, in which threat actors distributed malicious RTF documents exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to deploy a variety of commodity RATs, such as DarkCrystal RAT, QuasarRAT, and AndroRAT. \n\nIn January 2022, ThreatLabz observed a crypto scam, dubbed \"FreeCryptoScam,\" in which threat actors lured crypto users to download malicious payloads of DarkCrystal RAT, leading to further deployment of RedLine and TVRat malware.\n\nIn June 2022, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) reported that threat actors used phishing email messages containing RAR archives with macro-embedded documents to distribute DarkCrystal RAT among Ukrainian telecommunications operators. The same type of malware was also used in an attack against Ukrainian media organizations two weeks earlier, in which the Follina MSDT vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) was exploited.",

Revive is named after one of its functions that enables the malware to restart itself if terminated.  \n\nRevive, based on the open source code of the Teardroid spyware, usually spreads through phishing messages that lead the victims to malicious pages hosting seemingly legitimate two-factor authentication (2FA) apps. The pages have a professional look and even contain video tutorials to guide the users on how to install the malicious app. Once it is downloaded, the app requests permissions to the device‚Äôs Accessibility Service, enabling the embedded malware to get complete control of the screen. In addition, it requests access to SMS and phone calls and conducts ‚Äúon-device phishing‚Äù by presenting the victim with a credential harvesting page impersonating the bank‚Äôs login page. Revive also features a keylogger module and has the ability to intercept received SMS messages, mainly aimed at stealing one-time passwords and 2FA codes. All the gathered information is sent to a remote command and control (C2) server.      ",

It was initially offered on underground hacking forums for a basic rental price of $2,500.\n\nMatanbuchus usually spreads through malspam email messages containing ZIP files with MSI installers (with valid certificates) or Microsoft Excel documents with malicious macro codes. These lead to the deployment of obfuscated DLL files embedding the malware. Once deployed, the malware creates a scheduled task to maintain persistence and establishes communication with a command and control (C2) server. Matanbuchus can be used to launch EXE and DLL files in memory and execute custom PowerShell commands. In addition, it makes Base64-encoded POST requests to the C2 server to load different types of malware, such as Cobalt Strike beacons and QakBot (AKA Qbot). To evade detection, the malware makes a number of API calls that are commonly used in anti-virtualization and anti-debugging checks.   ",

The Malaysian pro-Muslim group targets organizations in Asia and the Middle East, especially in countries that are considered by them enemies of the Muslims, such as Israel, India, and the United States. \n\nDragonForce Malaysia primarily engages in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements. The threat actors are assumed to gain initial access through brute-forcing and by exploiting system vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2022-26134). They use mobile devices or Kali Linux as the main attack platforms.\n\nDragonForce Malaysia operates a dedicated website, containing a radio channel, active hacker forums with around 15,000 registered members, information about active campaigns, and tutorials of hacking techniques and tools. In addition, the group is very active on social media, operating Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram accounts. The group members use these accounts to make announcements and also to leak stolen content, in addition to Pastebins, AnonFiles, and Google Drive.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "DragonForce Malaysia gained recognition following its widespread campaign against Israeli entities initiated in June 2021. The #OpsBedil campaign was considered a response to Israel‚Äôs attempts to establish diplomatic relations with Southeast Asian nations with a Muslim majority (e.g. Indonesia) and to Israel's operation against terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip (Operation Guardian of the Walls). The campaign included the defacement of AcadeME, an Israeli job searching website for students, while stealing and leaking the personal data of more than 280,000 AcadeME users. In a subsequent campaign, #OpsBedil 2.0, the threat actors initiated DDoS attacks against the Israeli banking sector, leaked passport data of Israeli citizens, leaked VPN credentials of dozens of Israeli companies, and defaced the websites of the Ramon Airport and other aerospace organizations. The campaign operators used various DoS tools, such as Torshammer, LOIC, HOIC, and mobile tools like Garuda.   \n\nSince then, DragonForce Malaysia and its affiliates initiated several other cyber campaigns against Israel, such as #OpsBedilReloaded and #OpsRWM (Raids Without Mercy).\n\nIn June 2022, DragonForce Malaysia launched a campaign against the government of India. The #OpsPatuk campaign included DDoS attacks and defacements of Indian websites in both the private and public sectors. The attacks followed controversial remarks about the Prophet Mohammed that were made by Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The threat actors likely gained initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Atlassian‚Äôs Confluence Server and Data Center (CVE-2022-26134) and by deploying web shells (e.g. SQL upload shell to bypass the Admin SQL). In addition, the group members used Google dorks to efficiently identify their targets (e.g. limiting the search to domains ending with .gov.in) and applied the Script Deface (SC) tool for website defacement.\n\nIn addition, CloudSEK researchers reported that DragonForce Malaysia shared a proof-of-concept (PoC) of an exploit for Windows Server local privilege escalation (LPE) and local distribution router (LDR) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities might be used by the group in active campaigns. The group operators also expressed their intent to engage in ransomware operations.   \n\nDragonForce Malaysia is assisted by the following hackers and hacktivist groups: HarimauMalayaCyberArmy, BlackShieldCrew, Varians19Crew, HacktivistOfGaruda, TeamRevolutionPK, FoursdeathTeam, YameniHacker, X7R00T, BangladeshMuslimHackers, QwertyCode, BazTeamHackers, FroggBaba, ElegantCyberSecurity, RzkyO, 1877, 4EXPLOITATION, AnarchistAllies,  GanoSecTeam, KarawangCyberTeam, TeamRevolutionPK, Matigan1337, MrNyx, KosameAmegai, Cyber00t, Calutax07, ClashHackers, BDKR28, ABDO10, mranderson, Newbie_Tersakiti, Toku, silver_sword, CodeBoy187,7 n0m0r3, and Cubjrnet7.

            "Overview": "The Legion pro-Russian hacktivist group (not to be confused with the Indian hacktivist group of the same name) has been active since April 2022, amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. The group seems to be part of the Killnet hacktivist group, initiating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Western organizations and governments, primarily in NATO countries and Ukraine. Legion (AKA Cyber Spetsnaz) uses MHDDoS, Blood, Karma DDoS, Hasoki, DDoS Ripper, and GoldenEye scripts, to generate malicious traffic and shut down its targets‚Äô domains. The group operates a Telegram channel that is used to announce its latest victims and coordinate attacks.   \n\nIn April 2022, Legion built one of its first divisions called ‚ÄúZarya‚Äù and announced that it was looking for experienced penetration testers, OSINT specialists, and hackers. Not long after, the group initiated a vast DDoS attack against NATO, taking down domains assigned to the NATO infrastructure.   \n\nIn May 2022, Legion came to prominence when it attacked Italian organizations and threatened to launch DDoS attacks against the 2022 final of the Eurovision song contest, following Russia‚Äôs exclusion from the event. In addition, the group announced the launch of a new campaign, Panopticon, aiming to recruit 3,000 volunteer hackers willing to participate in attacks against the European Union and Ukrainian entities.   \n\nIn June 2022, another sub-division called ‚ÄúSparta‚Äù was created by Legion, aiming to perform cyber sabotage, disrupt internet resources, steal data, and gather financial intelligence, specifically on NATO and its allies.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Other sub-divisions associated with Legion‚Äôs activity include: Phoenix, Rayd, Vera, FasoninnGung, Mirai, Jacky, DDOS Gung, and Sakurajima. Some of them were responsible for attacks against five logistic terminals in Italy (Sech, Trieste, TDT, Yilprort, VTP), major financial institutions, web resources in Germany, and government entities in Poland, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Senate, Border Control, and the Police.\n\nOn June 21, 2022, Legion declared war against Lithuanian organizations from different sectors, such as government entities, banks, logistic companies, internet providers, airports, energy firms, and mass media groups. Two days later, the National Cyber Security Center (NKSC) of Lithuania issued a warning against an increase in DDoS attacks targeting public authorities in the country. As a result of the attacks, Lithuania's transportation agencies, financial institutions, and others experienced temporary service disruptions. The NKSC did not blame Legion for the attacks, but the proximity of events suggests its attribution.\n\nOn June 29, 2022, Norway's National Security Authority (NSM) warned against DDoS attacks targeting the country's websites and online services. Although the NSM's announcement did not reveal the identity of the attackers, some of the targeted websites appeared on the Legion Telegram channel. The targeted entities included Norway's national police, the country's public services, and immigration agencies. Legion seemed to target Norway in response to its pro-Ukraine actions amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. ",

            "Overview": "The ZuoRAT malware, first reported in June 2022, has been active since at least October 2020. The malware targets organizations in North America and Europe by breaching small office and home office (SOHO) routers (e.g. ASUS, Cisco, DrayTek, and NETGEAR) of remotely-working employees, especially since the COVID-19 outburst.\n\nZuoRAT, a heavily modified version of the Mirai botnet, is loaded into vulnerable networks in the form of a MIPS file, with the help of an authentication bypass exploit script. Then, the malware performs in-depth network reconnaissance, collects network traffic on UDP, DNS, and TCP connections, conducts DNS and HTTPS hijacking, and drops a C++-based shellcode loader. The loader delivers Cobalt Strike and custom backdoors, such as CBeacon and GoBeacon, which enable the threat actors to gain persistence, upload and download files, hijack network communications, inject new processes, and execute arbitrary commands on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The ZuoRAT operators rely on an obfuscated, multi-stage command and control (C2) infrastructure and use a dedicated virtual private server (VPS) to deploy their first-stage payloads. In addition, to conceal their presence, the threat actors leverage the compromised routers themselves as proxy C2 servers.  \n\nThe identity of the ZuoRAT operators is yet to be known, although they are assumed to be Chinese (possibly state-sponsored), based on some code hints and the use of Alibaba's Yuque and Tencent as part of their C2 infrastructure.

The malware primarily targets government and military organizations across the globe, but was also observed infecting organizations from other sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, transportation, and non-government organizations (NGOs).\n\nSessionManager, written in C++, is a malicious native-code module for Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server software that is loaded to the victim‚Äôs system by exploiting known vulnerabilities, such as ProxyLogon in Microsoft Exchange servers. SessionManager masquerades as a legitimate module aiming to process HTTP requests that are constantly sent to the server, but in fact is designed to process specific requests from the threat actors, execute their instructions, and then cunningly pass them to the server just as any other request. The malware‚Äôs main purpose is to help the attacker maintain system persistence and keep access while remaining hidden. Once deployed, SessionManager enables its operators to manipulate files (read, write, and delete), execute arbitrary commands, and establish communications with other endpoints in the network while manipulating traffic. In addition, the backdoor provides access to the victim‚Äôs email messages, steals in-memory user credentials, collects general system information, and can be used to deliver additional payloads, such as Mimikatz and ProcDump. \n\nSessionManager is attributed to the Gelsemium threat group, based on similar victimology and the use of the OwlProxy backdoor variant as part of its malicious campaign.",

The malicious documents contain an OLE object that leads to the deployment of an HTML file with JavaScript code exploiting system vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2022-30190). Then, a Base64-encoded string is downloaded and executes PowerShell commands to create persistence in the Windows startup directory and trigger the malware. Once deployed, X-Files can collect general system information (e.g. OS version and geolocation), take screenshots, and steal web browser data (e.g. saved passwords and credit cards, cookies, and history), cryptocurrency information, files that are stored on the desktop, and user credentials for Discord and Telegram.

The ransomware performs an anti-analysis check to make sure that it is not running in a virtual environment and then encrypts the files that are stored on the compromised system using the Curve25519 algorithm, appending them with different extensions (.babyk, .AstraLocker, .piton, .Astra, or a randomized extension). In addition, AstraLocker terminates processes that could interfere with the encryption, deletes volume shadow copies (VSS) to prevent file restoration, and stops backup and antivirus services.        \n\nThe AstraLocker operators take the ‚Äúsmash and grab‚Äù approach of maximizing profits in minimum time. They do not waste time on reconnaissance, evaluation of valuable files, and lateral movement, and only focus on local encryptions for small ransom payouts of 50$ to be paid in Monero or Bitcoin. \n\nThere are some links between the operators of AstraLocker and Chaos ransomware.

            "Overview": "The Chaos ransomware builder (AKA FakeRyuk, RyukJoke, Ryuk .Net) was first observed in June 2021. It is in a high probability an upgraded version of the Bagli ransomware, developed by a Russian-speaking threat actor, with a certain affinity to Azerbaijan. The ransomware developers presented it as a .NET version of the Ryuk ransomware, however apart from the GUI presentation, there are not many similarities between them in terms of functionality. <br/><br/>Since being discovered, the ransomware has been issued six recorded versions, each adding more functionalities. The first version (Chaos v1.0) acted more like a wiper trojan, rather than a ransomware, not providing any incentive for the victims to pay the ransom. Instead of encrypting the files, it corrupted them by replacing their content with random bytes and then encoding them in Base64. The malware searched for certain file paths and extensions to infect, before dropping a ransom note dubbed ‚Äúread_it.txt,‚Äù containing a ransom demand in bitcoin. In addition, it had a worming function, which enabled it to infect all the drives found on the compromised network. <br/><br/>The second version (Chaos v2.0) had more options for admin privileges, the ability to delete shadow copies and other backups, and the ability to disable Windows recovery mode.<br/><br/>The third version (Chaos v3.0) added the ability to encrypt files, using AES/RSA encryption, and the fourth version expanded the upper limit of files that can be encrypted to 2 MB. <br/><br/>The fourth version (Chaos v4.0) also provided the ransomware builders the ability to add different extensions to the encrypted files and change the victims‚Äô desktop wallpaper. This version was weaponized by the Onyx ransomware group. <br/><br/>The fifth version (Chaos v5.0) was primarily created to enable the ransomware to encrypt files larger than 2 MB without corrupting them and go beyond the C:// drive. This version used the AES-256 algorithm to encrypt files and was added the capability to disable the Windows task manager. <br/><br/>The sixth Chaos installment was observed in the wild in May 2022 and was named \"Yashma.\" It featured the ability to terminate its operation based on the victim's location and to stop the activity of various processes, such as antivirus software, remote desktop applications, and vault, backup, and storage services.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In October 2021, cybersecurity researchers observed the Chaos ransomware spread in gaming forums, infecting Minecraft players, specifically Japanese. The lure was ‚ÄúMinecraft alt list‚Äù text files, allegedly containing stolen Minecraft account credentials. Once those files were downloaded, the Chaos ransomware executables were triggered, encrypting the files on the victims‚Äô computers, appending them an extension of four random characters or digits, and dropping a ransom note. The ransom demand was equal to 2,000 yen, to be paid either by bitcoin or pre-paid cards.<br/><br/>In July 2022, Emsisoft released a decryptor for the AstraLocker ransomware, which was based on the Yashma variant. The security vendor released three keys to decrypt files with .AstraLocker or a random .[a-z0-9]{4} extension.

            "Overview": "TrickBot emerged in September 2016 from the banking Trojan, Dyre. Security researchers noted many similarities between Dyre and TrickBot, which targets banking information. Dyre was shut down after the authorities conducted a successful raid in November 2015. The malware‚Äôs authors, however, seem poised to make a comeback with this TrickBot Trojan.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Initial TrickBot samples only had one functional module present, which was designed to record the system information of the infected device. Researchers spotted a new module in October 2016 that contained web injects, but these appeared to be in the developmental phase and not yet finalized.<br><br>In the first half of 2019, a triple threat attack was discovered, targeting large enterprises. The threat actors used spam emails to deliver the Emotet trojan in order to distribute the TrickBot malware. Once a machine is infected with the TrickBot malware, it begins to steal sensitive information and the malware tries to determine if the company is an industry target. If so, they deliver the Ryuk ransomware and encrypt the data.<br><br>In November 2019, TrickBot was deployed by phishing emails that contain fake sexual harassment complaints, targeting employees of large companies. Those complaints appear as if they came from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.<br><br>In mid-November 2019, Virtual Care Provider Inc. (VCPI) was hit by the Ryuk ransomware. VCPI declined to pay the ransom demand, and the attack cut off many of VCPI‚Äôs elder care facilities from their patient records, email, and telephone service for weeks while VCPI rebuilt its network. The threat actors laid the groundwork for the attack using Emotet, which primed VCPI‚Äôs servers and endpoints. Then, they used Trickbot to download other malware and steal passwords from infected VCPI endpoints. Several data logs suggest that the attackers had breached VCPI‚Äôs network on multiple occasions over 14 months.<br><br>In April 2020, security researchers discovered a campaign delivering the 'BazarBackdoor' malware. Security researchers strongly assess that the developers of the TrickBot trojan are behind BazarBackdoor, due to the spam origin, method of operation, code overlap analysis, and infrastructure. Both the BazarBackdoor and Trickbot utilize the same crypter and email chain deliverables as previous TrickBot campaigns. Furthermore, BazarBackdoor's command and control servers (TLS communications) have been seen using certificates created in the same manner that historic TrickBot certificates have been created.<br><br>Between October 2019 and April 2020, the operators of the Trickbot malware and also the FIN6 threat group have paired up to target several organizations with TrickBot‚Äôs malware framework, Anchor. Anchor is an ‚Äúall-in-one attack framework,‚Äù made up of various submodules that can help attackers spread laterally on a network, for example with the ability to install backdoors. In these attacks, they also use the PowerTrick tool, which enables attackers stealthiness, persistence, and reconnaissance inside infected high-value targets such as financial institutions. The attackers used Anchor and PowerTrick to download and execute a loader, called Terraloader, which then installed a backdoor known as More_eggs, which is associated with FIN6. The victims of this campaign were mostly enterprise networks, including PoS systems. The attacks are likely initiated through malicious spam (malspam) campaigns, which is how TrickBot is typically delivered.<br><br>In June 2020, a phishing email campaign that claimed to deliver a survey on ‚ÄòBlack Lives Matter‚Äô was spreading the TrickBot information-stealing malware. When a recipient opens the attached Word document, they will receive a message to 'Enable Editing' and 'Enable Content' to view the contents properly. Once they click on these buttons, the Word document will run macros that download and execute a malicious DLL. This DLL is the TrickBot Trojan that will download further modules to the infected computer to steal files, passwords, security keys, and allow other threat actors to install ransomware.<br><br>After being downloaded, Trickbot spreads laterally through a network, to steal saved browser credentials, Active Directory Services databases, cookies and OpenSSH keys, credentials for RDP, VNC, and PuTTY, and more.<br><br>In October 2020, a Virginia, USA court granted Microsoft control over many internet servers that Trickbot uses in its malicious operations, based on claims that the crime machine abused Microsoft‚Äôs trademarks. To take down the backend infrastructure of the TrickBot botnet, Microsoft worked with a coalition of tech companies including Microsoft, ESET, Symantec, and FS-ISAC.<br><br>The coalition spent months collecting more than 125,000 TrickBot malware samples. During this time, the coalition analyzed the content and extracted and mapped information about the malware's inner workings, including all the servers the botnet used to control infected computers and serve additional modules. It appears, however, that this operation has not completely disabled the botnet.<br><br>Despite the coalition's attempt to disable the servers that Trickbot uses to control infected computers and serve additional modules, on October 15, 2020 researchers discovered that the malware is still being used in active campaigns, delivered by the Emotet Trojan.<br><br>On October 28, 2020, researchers discovered that TrickBot's authors have moved portions of their code to Linux in an attempt to widen the scope of victims that could be targeted.<br><br>In December 2020, the Trickbot botnet has integrated into its toolset a module that focuses on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) vulnerabilities. This demonstrates the actor‚Äôs effort to take attacks at a level that would give them ultimate control over infected machines. With access to UEFI firmware, the threat actor could establish persistence on the compromised machine that resists operating system reinstalls or replacing of storage drives. Its main use is to foil recovery attempts from ransomware attacks.<br><br>In the same month, the TrickBot operators initiated a phishing campaign in the UK, spreading malicious email messages pretending to be Subway order confirmations.<br>TrickBot was also connected to an Emotet campaign, involving the deployment of the Ryuk ransomware or attempts to steal bank account credentials via the TrickBot banking Trojan.<br><br>In February 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported that TrickBot started to use a copy of the Masscan open-source utility, dubbed \"masrv,\" in order to scan local networks for other systems with sensitive or open ports that can be attacked.<br><br>On October 10, 2021, another phishing campaign involving TrickBot was detected. The campaign included the spreading of phishing email messages with malicious macro attachments that once enabled dropping the TrickBot malware into the victim's system. This attack came despite the arrest of two TrickBot developers earlier that year.<br><br>On October 28, 2021, a Russian citizen assumed to be a member of the TrickBot malware development team has been extradited to the United States. The Russian national called Vladimir Dunaev (AKA FFX) was arrested in South Korea two months earlier and was accused of various cyber crimes that could put him 60 years in prison.<br><br>In November 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported that the TrickBot and Conti operators were responsible for the resurrection of the Emotet botnet. <br><br>Later that month, it was reported that the TrickBot operators started to implement a screen resolution verification code in the HTML attachments that were sent to victims as part of malspam email messages. The threat actors already added a year earlier a malware feature that terminated the infection chain, in case a device was using non-standard screen resolutions of 800x600 and 1024x768. However, in a new variation of this feature, the verification code has been added to the HTML attachment itself, as a security evasion mechanism.<br><br>In January 2022, IBM researchers reported that the TrickBot developers equipped it with new security evasion and anti-analysis mechanisms. The malware was added several obfuscation and base64 layers, such as minified code that makes it unreadable to human eyes, string extraction and replacement, dead (redundant) code injections, and monkey patching functions. In addition, malicious code injections to web pages were designed to not use local resources in the process, but only rely on the threat actors' servers, and the C2 communication is now made via HTTPS protocol. The new malware features also include anti-debugging script in the JavaScript code (RegEx) that can detect analysis tools and crash the researcher's web browser upon discovery of such tools.<br><br>In February 2022, Check Point researchers reported that since 2020, TrickBot was used in more than 20 modules to target customers of 60 financial and technology companies, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and PayPal. The researchers detailed some of the evolved TrickBot techniques and tools, such as the injectDll web-injects module that is used to steal banking and credential data, while utilizing anti-deobfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. In addition, they mentioned the pwgrabc credential stealer, and the tabDLL module that is also used to steal user credentials and utilize them to furtherly spread the malware via the SMBv1 network share, while leveraging the EternalRomance exploit.  <br><br>In the same month, AdvIntel researchers reported that the Conti ransomware group completely took over the operation of the TrickBot malware, and plans to permanently replace it with the more advanced and stealthy BazarBackdoor.<br><br>On February 24, 2022, TrickBot‚Äôs server infrastructure was finally taken down, marking the end of the malware activity. However, shortly after the shutdown IBM Security X-Force reported that the TrickBot operators continue to refine their arsenal. The threat actors were observed deploying a new version of the AnchorDNS backdoor, dubbed AnchorMail. The new backdoor version uses an email-based C2 server, while communicating with SMTP and IMAP protocols over TLS.<br><br>In March 2022, amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War, a Ukrainian member of the Conti ransomware group leaked internal chats concerning TrickBot and its C2 server source code. The leaks provided further support for the connection between the operations of Conti and TrickBot.<br><br>In April 2022, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) issued a warning against phishing attacks, attributed to the TrickBot operators, targeting Ukrainian organizations. The threat actors used macro-embedded documents with lures related to the Azovstal factory (connected to the Siege of Mariupol), leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike.<br><br>In July 2022, IBM Security X-Force published a broad overview of TrickBot's activity amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. Since February 2022, the TrickBot operators have initiated at least six campaigns targeting Ukrainian entities. The threat actors used phishing email messages to distribute different types of malware and hacking tools, such as IcedID, CobaltStrike, AnchorMail, and Meterpreter. Some of which were deployed using a novel Microsoft Excel downloader. To evade detection, the threat actors used a new crypter dubbed Forest that was sometimes used in conjunction with the Bumblebee loader.<div><br></div><div>In February 2023,&nbsp;the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on seven Russian individuals for their involvement in the operations of TrickBot. As a result of the sanctions, all property and funds that belong to these individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom were blocked and it is now prohibited to perform any kind of transactions with them. According to the UK government, the threat actors&nbsp;were responsible for 149 attacks on UK individuals and companies and received&nbsp;ransom payments of at least ¬£27,000,000.</div>",

            "Overview": "The Checkmate ransomware group, first observed by cybersecurity researchers in June 2022, has been active since at least May 2022. The group targets unupdated and weakly-protected QNAP NAS devices.<br/><br/>Checkmate gains initial system access through brute-force attacks against Server Message Block (SMB) services that are exposed to the internet. Upon encryption, the ransomware appends files with the .checkmate extension and drops a ransom note named !CHECKMATE_DECRYPTION_README. The ransom notes contain details about the encrypted data, a ransom demand to be paid in Bitcoin (around $15,000), and a link to a Telegram channel through which to contact the threat actors.<br/><br/>On July 7, 2022, QNAP issued a security advisory against Checkmate attacks and recommended its customers not expose their NAS devices to internet access and to use VPN to reduce the attack surface. In addition, QNAP advised disabling SMB 1, updating the operating system to the latest available version, using strong passwords, and ensuring regular data backups for easy restoration. ",

Once deployed, ABCsoup establishes a command and control (C2) connection and starts collecting personal information to deliver personalized ads, fingerprinting searches, and injecting malicious JavaScript codes to log user keystrokes and monitor web browser activity. The customized code is injected on active websites that are opened in the web browser, such as Yandex, Rambler, and Kismia. In addition, ABCsoup searches for active social networking services like Odnoklassniki and VK, and if found, collects user data, such as name, date of birth, and gender.

            "Overview": "The Rozena backdoor (AKA Bedep) has been active since at least January 2015. The malware targets Windows systems by exploiting vulnerabilities found in various Windows components, such as Windows VBScript engine (CVE-2018-8174) and Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (CVE-2022-30190).\n\nRozena is distributed through various methods, including malware loaders, phishing email messages containing malicious attachments, and drive-by downloads from compromised websites. Once deployed, Rozena connects to a remote server (e.g. Discord CDN) to fetch additional files and execute obfuscated PowerShell scripts. These scripts lead to the injection of a shellcode that launches a reverse shell back to the attackers‚Äô machine enabling them full remote access. With this access, the malware operators can collect information, download and upload files, and deploy additional malware into the infected machine. To avoid detection, Rozena employs the ‚Äúfileless‚Äù technique of running malicious commands or launching scripts directly from memory, and it also downloads legitimate files (e.g. Microsoft Word) as decoy. In addition, the malware was observed using the server-side polymorphism technique to hide some of its executed files. \n\nRozena terminates its operation if it detects that it runs in a virtual environment or if the default system language is Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Chinese. The latter feature may imply the origin of the malware operators (Eastern Europe or China).\n\nSecurity researchers found similarities between Rozena‚Äôs PowerShell scripts and the ones used by the Ursnif malware (AKA Gozi).",

            "Overview": "APT31 (AKA ZIRCONIUM, JUDGMENT PANDA, BRONZE VINEWOOD) is a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that has been active since at least early 2016, and has historically targeted foreign companies to steal intellectual property, it was also known to target diplomatic entities.\n\nAlthough this threat actor was first seen in 2016, very little is known about it in the cyber security community.\n",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In June 2020, researchers published that this group was targeting the Biden campaign and staff in the US election campaign. The targets of these attacks usually fell into two categories:\n1. People who are closely associated with US presidential campaigns and candidates.\n2. Prominent individuals in the international affairs community and staff members of international affairs departments in the US.\n\nGoogle security researchers detected phishing attempts against the personal email accounts of staffers on the Joe Biden and Donald Trump campaigns. The attacks were committed by Chinese and Iranian state-sponsored threat groups APT31 and APT35, respectively. As a part of the campaign, APT31 also deployed targeted malware on its victim‚Äôs systems.\n\nBetween July and September 2020, Google terminated more than 3,000 fake YouTube channels. These channels were part of a large spam network linked to China that attempted to run an influence operation on YouTube. First, these channels posted spam content in Mandarin such as videos of animals. Then, they started posting content in Mandarin about issues related to Hong Kong and China's response to Covid-19. Finally, they posted content in English and Mandarin about current events in the US, such as protests around racial justice, the wildfires on the West Coast, and the US response to Covid-19.\n\nIn February 2021, Check Point researchers reported that Chinese threat actors cloned and used a Windows zero-day exploit stolen from the NSA's Equation Group years before the privilege escalation flaw was patched. This tool called Jian was actively utilized between 2014 and 2017 exploiting CVE-2017-0005 (Windows GDI Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability).\nThe researchers reported that the investigation into Jian exposed a module containing four privilege escalation exploits that were part of Equation Group's DanderSpritz post-exploitation framework. \n\nTwo of the exploits in the framework, dating back to 2013, were zero-day flaws. One of the exploits was ‚ÄúEpMe‚Äù, whereas another, dubbed \"EpMo,\" appears to have been quietly patched in May 2017 by Microsoft as a follow-up fix in response to the Shadow Brokers leak but was not assigned a CVE. The remaining code names are EIEi and ErNi.\nCredits:\nhttps://research.checkpoint.com/2021/the-story-of-jian/\n\nIn March 2021, Finnish officials blamed APT31 for breaching the Parliament‚Äôs internal IT systems in the fall of 2020. \n\nIn June 2021, Norway accused APT31 of the 2018 breach of the government‚Äôs IT network. Security researchers discovered some overlaps between APT31 and APT10, another Chinese group that was earlier associated with that breach.\n\nIn March 2022, Google announced that it blocked phishing messages that were sent by APT31 a month earlier. The messages were sent as part of a campaign targeting Gmail users affiliated with the US government.\n\nIn July 2022, Proofpoint researchers named APT31 among threat groups that have been observed targeting journalists for cyberespionage purposes since early 2021. APT31 sent phishing email messages to US-based journalists covering US politics and national security, as well as the US and European engagement in the Russo-Ukrainian War. The messages contained web beacons that alerted the threat actors once they were accessed and enabled them to gather information, such as the victim's IP address, geolocation, and the internet service provider (ISP). This information might have been used to initiate further system infiltration. \n\nIn the same month, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium published an announcement stating the involvement of several Chinese APT groups, including APT31, in attacks targeting the country's defense and interior ministries. The Belgian minister urged the Chinese authorities to take action against the threat groups; however, China denied the accusations.",

            "Overview": "The Joker Android Trojan (AKA Bread) has been active since at least 2017. It spreads globally, masquerading as legitimate Google Play applications, and steals sensitive information. The malware is named after one of its command and control (C2) domains. The UI of the Joker‚Äôs C2 panel, as well as some of the comments in its code, are written in Chinese, which may point to the origins of the malware‚Äôs developers. \n\nJoker was observed in thousands of Android apps that take many forms, such as security software, QR scanners, wallpaper and emoji stores, and medical apps. Once installed, the malware connects to a C2 server and downloads a malicious Dalvik executable (DEX) payload, which provides access to the device‚Äôs NotificationListenerService. Then, Joker can intercept SMS messages, access the contact list, collect general device information, and even create a simulation of clicks that enable it to register to premium services (also known as \"toll billing\" or \"fleeceware\"). \n\nThe malware employs various obfuscation techniques to evade security software detection and adapts to the latest updates by Google Play Protect in order to bypass its defenses. In addition, it receives dynamic code and commands over HTTP and runs them through JavaScript-to-Java callbacks, which provides an additional protection layer. Recent malware versions also leverage a developer tool called ‚ÄúFlutter‚Äù that prevents detection.\n\nIn January 2020, Google stated that Google Play Protect detected and removed approximately 1,700 Joker-infected apps from its play store since 2017; however, new malicious apps keep emerging.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In April 2021, it was reported that more than half a million Huawei users were infected with the Joker malware, after downloading malicious apps that masqueraded as virtual keyboards, camera apps, online messenger, and coloring programs.\n\nIn December 2021, cybersecurity researchers observed the ‚ÄúColor Message‚Äù Android application infected with Joker. The app was downloaded over half a million times before Google removed it. The researchers found that the app communicated with Russian servers.\n\nIn May 2022, Kaspersky researchers reported on another set of Trojanized applications spreading in Google Play and distributing the Joker malware. The applications masqueraded as messaging apps, apps for monitoring blood pressure, and for document scanning. The researchers found that between January 2021 and March 2022, Joker most frequently attacked users in Saudi Arabia, Poland, and Germany.\n\nIn July 2022, a new Joker variant dubbed Autolycos was observed to be distributed through malicious apps that were promoted on Facebook and Instagram. The new variant employed an improved security evasion mechanism of executing URLs on a remote browser and then including the result in HTTP requests. This instead of using WebView, which elevates the risk of the user noticing the infection.\n\nIn addition, cybersecurity researchers reported on dozens new malicious apps that acted as droppers for Joker, as well as other Android malware (e.g. Facestealer and Coper). To evade detection, the Joker operators hid the malicious payload in a common asset file and package application using commercial packers.",

It spreads indiscriminately in the Google Play Store and seems to be operated from Russia. \n\nFacestealer, short for Facebook credential stealer, impersonates legitimate Android apps, such as photo editors and VPN services, with the goal of stealing confidential Facebook information like user credentials and profile content. The compromised Facebook accounts might be used for various malicious purposes, such as committing financial frauds, sending phishing messages, and spreading fake news. \n\nOnce installed, the app uses the Android WebView object‚Äôs loadUrl API to launch a Facebook login page and asks the users to log into their accounts. Then, the malware injects malicious JavaScript code into the page, extracts sensitive information, and exfiltrates it to a command and control (C2) server at a Russian-registered domain.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In May 2022, Trend Micro researchers reported that they observed over 200 apps containing the Facestealer malware. The apps included VPN services, camera apps and photo editing services, among others. They were designed to steal user credentials and collect personal information associated with the victims' Facebook accounts.\n\nIn July 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on dozens new malicious apps that acted as droppers for Android malware, such as Facestealer, as well as Joker and Coper. Facestealer, hiding in a camera app with 5,000 downloads, exhorted victims to log into their Facebook accounts and stole their credentials.  ",

            "Overview": "The Gallium threat group (AKA Soft Cell, Red Dev 4) has been active since at least 2012. The Chinese APT group, likely to be state-sponsored, primarily targets telecommunication providers, financial institutions, and government entities in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\nGallium uses network scanning tools to detect and exploit vulnerable internet-facing services, such as WildFly/JBoss, and gain initial access to the victim‚Äôs network. Then, the threat actors typically install web shells, dump credentials, and use off-the-shelf as well as modified tools (e.g. PsExec and Mimikatz) to move laterally within the compromised system while evading security mechanisms. Some of the tools are even signed with valid (probably stolen) certificates to avoid suspicion. \n\nGallium has been observed using different types of malware, including BlackMould, China Chopper, Poison Ivy, and QuarkBandit. Some of the malware used was observed to be modified to increase stealthiness. Gallium uses malware for various malicious purposes, such as enumerating local drives, manipulating files, exfiltrating data, and executing arbitrary commands. Additionally, the threat actors were observed to employ SoftEther VPN software to gain access to and maintain persistence on the targeted systems. They typically lean on dynamic DNS subdomains to provide command and control (C2) infrastructure, hosted in China, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan. \n\nGallium was linked to the 2018 Operation Soft Cell, a global cyberespionage campaign targeting telecommunications providers. The tools that were used in the campaign were previously employed by other Chinese state-sponsored groups, such as APT10 and APT27, indicating a possible overlap between Gallium and these groups.  \t",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In June 2022, Palo Alto researchers reported a new and stealthy malware named PingPull that was used by Gallium in attacks against financial institutions and government entities in countries like Australia, Belgium, Russia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The malware, written in Visual C++, enabled the threat actors to access a reverse shell and run arbitrary commands for file manipulation, enumeration of storage volumes, and more. The researchers discovered three PingPull variants with similar functionality using different C2 communication protocols (ICMP, HTTPS, and TCP). In addition, they were able to link Gallium to over 170 IP addresses, some dating back to 2020. \n\nIn July 2022, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium published an announcement stating the involvement of several Chinese APT groups, including Gallium, in attacks targeting the country's defense and interior ministries. The Belgian minister urged the Chinese authorities to take action against the threat groups; however, China denied the accusations.\n\nOther tools that were used by Gallium include: HTRAN, NBTScan, Netcat, Windows Credential Editor (WCE), and WinRAR.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK¬Æ TTPs:\n\nT1583.004 - Acquire Infrastructure: Server\nT1560.001 - Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\nT1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\nT1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\nT1136.002 - Create Account: Domain Account\nT1005 - Data from Local System\nT1074.001 - Data Staged: Local Data Staging\nT1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\nT1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application\nT1133 - External Remote Services\nT1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading\nT1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer\nT1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer\nT1036.003 - Masquerading: Rename System Utilities\nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1027.002 - Software Packing\nT1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools\nT1588.002 - Obtain Capabilities: Tool\nT1003.001 - OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\nT1003.002 - OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager\nT1090.002 - Proxy: External Proxy\nT1018 - Remote System Discovery\nT1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\nT1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell\nT1553.002 - Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing\nT1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery\nT1049 - System Network Connections Discovery\nT1033 - System Owner/User Discovery\nT1550.002 - Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash\nT1078 - Valid Accounts\nT1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation",

            "Overview": "The CloudMensis backdoor, first reported by ESET researchers in July 2022, has been active since at least February 2022. The malware targets macOS devices for data collection purposes. There is little information about the malware operators‚Äô attack vectors and specific targets. \n\nCloudMensis, developed in Objective-C, is deployed on the compromised device using code execution and elevation of administrative privileges. In the two-stage process, the first stage downloader fetches and executes a next stage malicious payload from a public cloud storage service, such as pCloud, Yandex Disk, or Dropbox. Once deployed, CloudMensis bypasses the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security framework to receive permissions to take screenshots,  scan connected removable storage devices, and capture keyboard events. If the Mac‚Äôs System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled, CloudMensis grants itself permissions by adding new rules to the TCC.db file. If SIP is enabled and the Mac is running any version of macOS Catalina earlier than 10.15.6, CloudMensis exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2020-9934) to make the TCC daemon (tccd) load a database to which CloudMensis can write. The malware supports 39 commands that enable it to steal documents, email messages and attachments, and files from removable storage devices. In addition, CloudMensis can run shell commands and download and execute arbitrary files. ",

One of the attacks targeted an intergovernmental organization dealing with international migration services. The attack's targeting and timeline corresponded with the Russo-Ukrainian War, in which pro-Russian threat actors were repeatedly observed targeting migration organizations. The threat actors sent their targets phishing email messages that contained Microsoft Office documents with malicious macro codes, leveraging VBA stomping technique to bypass static analysis and reverse engineering. Once the macro code was triggered, it executed a heavily obfuscated JavaScript that created a scheduled task to maintain persistence and dropped two files, a malware loader and an encrypted binary. To evade detection, the binary was injected using the \"Heaven's gate\" technique. Finally, a backdoor was deployed taking screenshots of the machine and exfiltrating them to a command and control (C2) server through an HTTP POST request.<br><br>In July 2022, Proofpoint researchers reported that the TA4563 was observed using the Evilnum malware to target European financial and investment entities, especially the ones engaging in forex, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The threat actors sent phishing email messages containing malicious Microsoft Word, ISO, or LNK files (sometimes packed in ZIP archives), leading to the deployment of the Evilnum backdoor. The backdoor, consisted of JavaScript and C# components, could be used for reconnaissance, data theft, or to load additional malware.<div><br></div><div>In August 2022, Kaspersky reported recurring attacks by Evilnum against&nbsp;foreign and cryptocurrency exchanges around the world from September 2020 until June 2022. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages with macro-embedded documents to distribute the VileRAT malware. The malware can execute arbitrary commands, log user keystrokes, establish persistence by creating scheduled tasks, detect security solutions, and update itself through its connected C2 server.</div><div><br></div><div>In December 2022, Kaspersky linked Evilnum to attacks against legal entities in 2020 and possibly 2021 using the Janicab malware. These attacks were also assumed to be part of an older campaign that&nbsp;has been traced back to early 2015 and targeted legal, financial, and travel agencies in the Middle East and Europe. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages that contained ZIP archives with LNK-based droppers. Once executed, the droppers led to the deployment of&nbsp;the VBScript-based Janicab implant.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Evilnum has used&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">YouTube&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">dead-drop resolvers (DDRs), i.e. employing&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">unlisted old YouTube links to host&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">C2 information that is later deciphered&nbsp;by the malware</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Similar to other malware used by Evilnum, such as Powersing,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Janicab can be used to execute commands received from the C2 server, import registry files, and download additional malware.

            "Overview": "The Atlas Intelligence Group (A.I.G, AKA Atlantis Cyber-Army), first reported by cybersecurity researchers in July 2022, has been active since at least May 2022. The hacker-for-hire threat group indiscriminately targets organizations around the world (e.g. the United States, Israel, and Pakistan) in various sectors, such as government, finance, manufacturing, and technology.<br/><br/>A.I.G employs a unique business model of outsourcing entire hacking campaigns to independent cyber mercenaries with different areas of expertise (e.g. pentesting or social engineering). The cyber mercenaries are recruited through the group‚Äôs Telegram channels and seem to change for each campaign. This way the group leaders can exclude themselves from the illicit activities and also make it difficult for security researchers and law officials to link between the campaigns. A.I.G offers a variety of services on its website, including access to stolen databases, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and initial access to enterprise networks through remote desktop protocol (RDP) clients and webshells. In addition, the group offers ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù access to sensitive information that was allegedly acquired through connections within law enforcement agencies. <br/><br/>All the activities are managed and coordinated by the group‚Äôs leader, \"Mr. Eagle.\" Other identified group members (El Rojo, Mr.Shawji, S41T4M4, and Coffee) are responsible for tasks such as advertising A.I.G's services, communicating with customers, and operating the group‚Äôs Telegram channels.  <br/><br/>A.I.G maintains at least three Telegram channels for different purposes; one is a marketplace for leaked databases, another contains ads for recruiting hacking experts, and the third serves as a communication channel with announcements, lists of intended targets, doxxing posts, and details about attack toolkits. Interestingly, the group also engages in voluntary hunting for pedophiles, publicly publishing their personal details, such as home addresses, phone numbers, and pictures. In addition, the group operates an e-commerce store on the Sellix.io platform, in which users can purchase the different A.I.G services as well as stolen databases, using cryptocurrency.<br/><br/>The Atlas Intelligence Group might be linked to the DDoSArmy threat group, based on some communications.

            "Overview": "The Redeemer ransomware was first observed in June 2021, after it was promoted on underground hacking forums. Redeemer follows a unique ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, allowing a free download of the ransomware builder along with an obligation to set aside 20% of the ransom payment to the ransomware developer, ‚ÄúCerebrate.‚Äù In July 2022, a newer version, Redeemer 2.0 was released, targeting Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, and 11.\n\nOnce deployed using admin privileges, Redeemer creates a mutex to make sure that only one instance of malware will run on the victim‚Äôs computer. Then, the ransomware, written in C/C++, creates a folder, copies itself into the Windows directory with legitimate file names, and executes itself as a new process using the ShellExecuteW() API function. In addition, Redeemer clears event logs and deletes volume shadow copies (VSS) and any system backups to cover its tracks and prevent file restoration. The ransomware terminates any process that might interfere with the encryption (e.g. mySQL) and generates ransom notes in the Winlogon registry key to warn the victim of the ransomware infection during the system restart. Next, Redeemer encrypts the files that are stored on the compromised system while appending them with the .redeem extension and changing their icon. The ransomware also adds a registry entry for the encrypted files that pops up a message with instructions once they are opened.\n\nThe Redeemer developers provide their affiliates with a GUI interface to build the ransomware executable and decryption tool, add communication channels (XMPP and Tox channels and up to two email addresses), provide the ransom amount (in Monero), and insert a campaign ID for tracking purposes. In addition, the developers operate a dedicated page on Dread, from which the affiliates can download the ransomware builder, get instructions, and receive support.   ",

            "Overview": "The DevilsTongue spyware was first reported by Microsoft researchers in June 2021. The malware targets politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and political dissidents, in many countries around the globe, such as the United Kingdom, Israel, Iran, Spain, Turkey, and Singapore. DevilsTongue was developed by the Israeli surveillanceware vendor, Candiru (AKA Sourgum).\n\nDevilsTongue, written in C/C++, can be deployed through various methods, including weaponized documents, malicious links on phishing messages, watering hole attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The malware is designed to exploit system vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771) enabling it to evade detection and elevate privileges. Once deployed, the malware loads encrypted DLL files into memory and uses COM hijacking to inject them into legitimate processes (e.g. svchost.exe) and achieve persistence. DevilsTongue can collect files, tamper registries, run Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) commands, and query SQLite databases. In addition, it can turn on the victim‚Äôs webcam and microphone, take screenshots, exfiltrate data from the Signal private messaging platform, and steal cookies and user credentials from LSASS and web browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox. These credentials can later be used to log into user accounts on social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) and email clients (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo, and Mail.ru). The compromised accounts might also be used to send phishing messages to additional victims and expand the scope of the attack. \n\nDevilsTongue‚Äôs command-and-control (C2) infrastructure involves more than 750 websites, including domains that impersonate legitimate organizations, such as advocacy organizations (e.g. Amnesty International and the Black Lives Matter movement), international media channels (e.g. CNN and France 24), tech companies (e.g. Microsoft, Apple, and Google), social media (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), and international organizations (e.g. the United Nations and the World Health Organization). \n\nLike other surveillanceware vendors, such as the NSO Group and RCS Lab, DevilsTongue‚Äôs developers, Candiru, sells its spyware and surveillance tools to military and intelligence agencies in countries of authoritarian regimes, such as in Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The use of Candiru‚Äôs spyware is restricted in other countries, including the United States, China, Iran, Israel, and Russia; however, this does not mean that the company‚Äôs products are not being used in those countries.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In July 2022, Avast researchers reported that since March 2022, DevilsTongue was observed leveraging a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2022-2294) to target journalists in the Middle East (e.g. Lebanon, Turkey, and Yemen). The malware was distributed through watering hole attacks, in which the DevilsTongue‚Äôs operators compromised websites and injected them with malicious JavaScript codes redirecting victims to attacker-controlled domains.  \n",

The malware was observed targeting Ukrainian entities amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War; however, it might have also been used to target entities from other regions as well.\n\nGoMet, written in Golang, gains system access by exploiting system vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1040). Once deployed, the malware can be used to create cronjobs (every two seconds), list files, connections, and processes, upload and download files, execute arbitrary commands, and use the initial access to spread to other connected networks and computers (‚Äúdaisy chain‚Äù). To evade detection when establishing persistence, GoMet enumerates the autorun values instead of creating a new one, and replaces one of the legitimate autorun executables with the malware. The malware communication with the command and control (C2) server is done through HTTPS on the default port. In case the C2 is unreachable, GoMet sleeps for a random amount of time between 5 and 10 minutes.   ",

            "Overview": "The Knotweed threat group has been active since at least February 2020. The group targets law firms, banks, and strategic consultancy organizations in countries such as Austria, the United Kingdom, and Panama. In July 2022, Knotweed was linked to the Austrian surveillanceware vendor, DSIRF (estd. 2016), which is tied to shady individuals, such as the white-collar criminal, Jan Marsalek.\n\nKnotweed gains initial system access by sending email messages containing Excel documents with malicious macro codes or PDF documents designed to exploit system vulnerabilities in Windows (e.g. CVE-2022-22047 and CVE-2021-31199) and Adobe Reader (CVE-2021-28550). These vulnerabilities enable the threat actors to gain administrative privileges, escape sandboxes, and execute malicious code remotely. Once infiltrating the system, Knotweed deploys Subzero spyware (AKA Corelump) that can log user keystrokes, take screenshots, exfiltrate files, and run remote shells and arbitrary plugins that are fetched from a command and control (C2) server. Knotweed also uses the heavily-obfuscated Jumplump malware loader to load the spyware into memory to evade detection. In addition, the threat actors were observed using these post-exploitation tools: Mex, containing multiple red teaming or security plugins copied from GitHub (e.g. Chisel, Mimikatz, and SharpExec), and the PassLib credential dumping tool, stealing passwords from web browsers, email clients, LSASS, the Windows credential manager, and more.         ",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Microsoft recommends several mitigation measures to counter Knotweed attacks:\n- Patch system vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2022-22047.\n- Confirm that the Microsoft Defender antivirus is updated to security intelligence update 1.371.503.0 or later.\n- Use the included indicators of compromise (IOC) to investigate whether they exist in your environment and assess for potential intrusion.\n- Change Excel macro security settings to control which macros run and under what circumstances when you open a workbook. \n- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials and ensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity. \n- Review all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure, with a particular focus on accounts configured with single factor authentication, to confirm authenticity and investigate any anomalous activity.\n\nThe full list of recommendations can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/07/27/untangling-knotweed-european-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits/  ",

The malware is offered for sale by a threat actor using the monikers \"Architect\" and \"goodluck.\"\n\nOcto is usually distributed by threat actors using landing pages that promote seemingly legitimate apps or software updates for download. The malware was observed to be distributed as part of various types of malicious applications acting as malware droppers, such as device cleaning, screen recording, and financial apps. Once the app is installed on a victim‚Äôs device, it disables Google Protect, establishes connection to a command and control (C2) server, and executes an obfuscated Octo payload. \n\nLike other banking malware, Octo can log user keystrokes, intercept and send SMS messages, lock the device‚Äôs screen, and launch applications. In addition, it has an advanced remote access module that enables its operators to perform on-device fraud (ODF) by abusing the Android AccessibilityService and performing overlay attacks. The malware can blacken the screen to hide its actions, while setting the screen brightness to zero and disabling all notifications. It also enables live screen streaming through Android's MediaProjection which captures the device‚Äôs screen in real-time.",

            "Overview": "The Pegasus spyware was developed by the Israeli cyber firm NSO Group. This tool can be covertly installed on mobile phones (and other devices) running most versions of iOS and Android.\n\nPegasus was discovered in August 2018 after a failed attempt of installing it on an iPhone belonging to a human rights activist. It led to an investigation revealing details about the spyware, its abilities, and the security vulnerabilities it exploited. \n\nPegasus' iOS exploitation was first identified in August 2016. An Emirati activist named Ahmed Mansoor received a text message promising \"secrets\" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates by following a link. Mansoor sent the link to Citizen Lab, which launched an investigation, with the collaboration with mobile security company Lookout.\n\nAs of 2016, Pegasus could read text messages, track calls, collect passwords, track location, access the target device's microphone and camera, and harvest information from apps. News of the spyware generated significant media coverage. It was called the \"most sophisticated\" smartphone attack ever and was the first time that a malicious remote exploit using jailbreak to gain unrestricted access to an iPhone had been detected.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "On August 23, 2020, according to intelligence obtained by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the NSO Group was reported to have sold Pegasus spyware software for hundreds of millions of US dollars to the United Arab Emirates and the other Gulf States, for surveillance of anti-regime activists, journalists, and political leaders from rival nations.\n\nIn July 2021, widespread media coverage of the Project Pegasus revelations and in-depth analysis by human rights group Amnesty International uncovered that Pegasus was still being widely exploited against high-profile targets. It showed that Pegasus was able to infect all modern iOS versions up to the latest release, iOS 14.6, through a zero-click iMessage exploit.\n\nIn an article published by The Washington Post On July 18th, 2021, it was reported that Pegasus was used in attempted and successful hacks of 37 smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists, business executives, and two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to an investigation by The Washington Post and 16 media partners.\n\nThe phones appeared on a list of more than 50,000 numbers that are concentrated in countries known to engage in surveillance of their citizens. The numbers on the list are unattributed, but reporters were able to identify more than 1,000 people spanning more than 50 countries through research and interviews on four continents: several Arab royal family members, at least 65 business executives, 85 human rights activists, 189 journalists, and more than 600 politicians and government officials ‚Äî including cabinet ministers, diplomats, and military and security officers. The numbers of several heads of state and prime ministers also appeared on the list. Among the journalists whose numbers appear on the list, which dates to 2016, are reporters working overseas for several leading news organizations, including a small number from CNN, the Associated Press, Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News, Le Monde in France, the Financial Times in London and Al Jazeera in Qatar.\n\nThe NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio expressed concern in a phone interview with The Washington Post reporters about some of the details that were reported in this case, while continuing to dispute that the list of more than 50,000 phone numbers had anything to do with NSO or Pegasus. ‚ÄúThe company cares about journalists and activists and civil society in general,‚Äù Hulio said. ‚ÄúWe understand that in some circumstances our customers might misuse the system and, in some cases like we reported in [NSO‚Äôs] Transparency and Responsibility Report, we have shut down systems for customers who have misused the system.‚Äù He said that in the past 12 months NSO had terminated two contracts over allegations of human rights abuses, but he declined to name the countries involved. In addition, Hulio said that they are investigating every allegation.\n\nAlso in July 2021, Amnesty International Security Lab and additional partners published a list of IOCs related to the Pegasus spyware:\nhttps://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso\n\nIn addition, The Amnesty International Security Lab has also released an open-source tool, the Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT). MVT can be used with the pegasus.stix2 indicators to check a device for potential signs of compromise with Pegasus spyware: https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt\n\nIn October 2021, it was reported that the phone of New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard was repeatedly hacked by Pegasus between June 2018 to June 2021, as he was reporting on Saudi Arabia. It was believed that the NSO Group leveraged at least three different iOS exploits: an iMessage zero-click exploit in December 2019, a KISMET exploit targeting iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7 starting July 2020, and a FORCEDENTRY exploit aimed at iOS 14.x until 14.7.1, since February 2021. NSO denied any involvement in the alleged breach.\n\nIn November 2021, the United States Commerce Department added four surveillanceware companies, including NSO Group, to the Entity List for engaging in \"malicious cyber activities.\" This decision practically imposed trade restrictions on NSO and mandated U.S. organizations to acquire a special license from the government to conduct business with the company.  \n\nIn the same month, Apple sued NSO Group and its parent company Q Cyber Technologies for spying on iPhone users with Pegasus. The lawsuit also aimed to prevent NSO from breaking into any Apple software, services, or devices. \n\nIn December 2021, it was reported that Apple notified 11 U.S. Embassy officials and State Department employees that their iPhones might have been infected with Pegasus. The officials were stationed in Uganda or focused on issues relating to the country.\n\n In January 2022, Finland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced that the devices of Finnish diplomats were hacked and infected with Pegasus. The malware infected both Apple and Android and might have been used to steal sensitive data.\n\nIn April 2022, Reuters reported that at least five senior officials in the European Union, including European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, were infected with Pegasus. NSO Group denied the claims and stated that the targeting \"could not have happened with NSO's tools.\"\n\nIn June 2022, NSO Group admitted to the European Union lawmakers that Pegasus was used by at least five countries in the region. The statement was made after a special inquiry committee was launched in April 2022 to investigate the accusations claiming that Pegasus was used to spy on European politicians, diplomats, and civil society members.\n\nOn July 17, 2022, Citizen Lab researchers reported that between October 2020 and November 2021 Pegasus was used to target at least 30 pro-democracy activists, academics, lawyers, and NGO workers in Thailand. The malware was distributed by leveraging two zero-click exploits, KISMET and FORCEDENTRY. \n\nOn July 27, 2022, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee held a hearing to discuss Pegasus and its implications for national policy. The House stressed the dangers of spyware to democracies around the world and was bound to pass legislation regulating the spyware industry.",

            "Overview": "The Mars Stealer malware was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in May 2021, after it was put for sale on underground hacking forums. The infostealer, which is promoted at the price range of $140-$160, is a redesign of the Oski malware.\n\nMars Stealer, written in ASM/C, is distributed through malspam campaigns spreading malicious macro-embedded documents, or social engineering techniques luring victims into downloading seemingly legitimate software, cracks, or keygens containing the malware. Once deployed, the Mars Stealer initiates security evasion routines to hide its WinAPI calls and uses the Sleep() function to disrupt debugging attempts. The malware also features string encryption techniques using a combination of RC4 and Base64 and its command and control (C2) connections are encrypted with the SSL protocol.\n\nMars Stealer retrieves its configuration from the C2 server and starts harvesting various types of data, such as general system information (e.g. IP address, geolocation, and timezone), user credentials, web browser information (e.g. autofill and extension data), credit card data, and cryptocurrency information. In addition, it uses the ‚Äúgrabber‚Äù function to steal private keys from two-factor authentication plugins. The Mars Stealer can also be used as a loader for other malware. At the end of the data gathering process, the stolen data is packed in a ZIP file and exfiltrated to the C2 server. Then, the malware deletes itself to cover its tracks.\n\nWhile the identity of the Mars Stealer developers is unknown, they are assumed to be Russian or Russian speakers. This is strengthened by the fact that the infostealer checks the language of the compromised operating system and aborts if it is one of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) languages: Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Armenian, Tajik, and Uzbek.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In March 2022, the Mars Stealer was reported to spread through Google Ads for fake OpenOffice websites. The malware operator targeted Canadian users, including a healthcare infrastructure provider, and several high-profile service companies in Canada. The users were exhorted to download OpenOffice installers that contained Mars Stealer executables packed with the Babadeda crypter or the Autoit loader. The security researchers who investigated the campaign attributed it to a Russian-speaking threat actor and discovered his GitLab account, operated under the name ‚ÄúTony Mont.‚Äù The researchers also revealed that the malware operator used stolen information to pay for the Google Ads and elevate their page rank.\n\nIn August 2022, the Mars Stealer was observed to be distributed through a fake website impersonating the portal of Atomic Wallet, a popular decentralized wallet and cryptocurrency exchange platform. The fake website contained a button for downloading the Atomic Wallet app, but instead downloaded a malicious ZIP archive. The ZIP contained a batch file executing a PowerShell command that led to the deployment of Mars Stealer, hosted on a Discord server.",

Once deployed, Manjusaka connects to a command and control (C2) server and can execute arbitrary commands, harvest web browser credentials from Chromium-based browsers, gather Wi-Fi SSID information, collect general system information (e.g. network account names and processor power information), and take screenshots of the desktop. It can also activate a file management module to enumerate files, create and delete files and directories, read and write file data, and move files between locations. Manjusaka‚Äôs C2 binaries can be either EXE files (for Windows systems) or Golang-based ELF files (for Linux systems).   \n\nManjusaka has a user interface in Simplified Chinese on GitHub that enables users to generate new implants with custom configurations with ease. This is expected to make this attack framework popular among threat actors, who might use it alongside other hacking tools, such as Sliver and Cobalt Strike.",

            "Overview": "The GwisinLocker ransomware group was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in July 2022. The group primarily targets industrial, pharmaceutical, and healthcare organizations in South Korea. GwisinLocker was developed by a Korean-speaking threat actor, Gwisin (‚Äúghost‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit‚Äù in Korean). \n\nGwisinLocker attacks both Windows and Linux environments. The ransomware is not operated automatically and requires command line arguments to be executed. For Windows operating systems, GwisinLocker gains initial access through an MSI installer file that loads an embedded DLL into a Windows process to evade antivirus detection. One of these arguments supports the operation of the ransomware in safe mode. For Linux operating systems, the encryption process usually takes place on VMware ESXi virtual machines. The GwisinLocker operators use command line arguments to terminate VM processes and several Linux daemons before initiating encryption using AES symmetric-key encryption with SHA256 hashing. The ransomware skips specific directories (e.g. ‚Äúbin,‚Äù ‚Äúboot‚Äù, and ‚Äúsys‚Äù) and VMware ESXi-related files (e.g. state.tgz, useropts.gz, and jumpstrt.gz) to avoid making the Linux server unusable.\n\nUpon encryption, GwisinLocker appends the files with either the .mcrgnx extension or a unique extension that carries the targeted company‚Äôs name. In addition, the desktop wallpaper changes to include an encryption notification, and a ransom note named ‚Äú!!!_HOW_TO_UNLOCK_[company_name]_FILES_!!!.TXT‚Äù is dropped. The ransom note is customized for each victim and contains the victim's name, the data that was stolen, and a dedicated Tor address for contacting the threat actors, along with a warning not to report the case to law enforcement or government agencies (e.g. the Korea Internet & Security Agency - KISA).

            "Overview": "The Bitter threat group (AKA Hazy Tiger, APT-C-08, Manlinghua) has been active since at least 2013. This South Asian APT group primarily targets energy, engineering, and government organizations, in countries such as China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBitter usually gains initial system access through spear phishing email messages that impersonate government entities or legitimate organizations, or through strategic web compromises. In each of these methods, the threat actors exhort their victims either to download a RAR archive that contains a Microsoft Office document (RTF or XLXS) that exploits remote code execution vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2021-1732), or to trigger malicious Android applications. Bitter was observed using the ArtraDownloader malware for its Windows campaigns and variations of AndroRAT for its Android campaigns. These variations include a custom malware, BitterRAT (AKA SlideRAT), that was also observed being used by other South Asian APT groups, such as Patchwork. BitterRAT can gather sensitive information and send it over HTTP POST requests to a remote command and control (C2) server.\n\nBitter was linked to other threat groups, such as Confucius, Patchwork, and Bahamut, through its used infrastructure and malicious arsenal; however, no solid connection could be established between the groups.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In May 2022, Cisco Talos reported that Bitter initiated a new campaign against the government of Bangladesh. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages with documents that exploited known vulnerabilities to deploy a novel Trojan named ZxxZ. The malware, compiled in Visual C++, featured anti-detection mechanisms and terminated antivirus processes. It was used to collect general system information, such as the victim's hostname, username, and operating system, and exfiltrate it to a remote C2 server.\n\nIn a follow-up report that was published by SECUINFRA in July 2022, the security researchers added that during its latest campaign in Bangladesh, Bitter used different types of malware, such as keyloggers, infostealers, and RATs, including the newly observed Almond RAT. Almond RAT, written in .NET, could be used to collect and exfiltrate data, execute arbitrary commands, load additional tools, and to establish persistence. The malware was observed using string encryption techniques to evade detection and reverse engineering.\n\nIn August 2022, Meta (formerly Facebook) announced that it took action against Bitter to block the group's activity and domain infrastructure. Bitter was reported to use social engineering techniques, creating fake online personas of attractive young women, journalists, or activists, to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading malware. On some occasions, the threat actors posted broken links or images of malicious links so users would have to type them into their browser rather than click on them. In addition, Bitter tried to convince users to download a chat application for iOS through Apple‚Äôs Testflight service for developers, that either contained malicious code or was used for further social engineering attempts. The group also used a new Android malware dubbed Dracarys that was injected into Trojanized applications impersonating YouTube, Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, and other legitimate services. Once installed, the malware could be used to access the device's stored files, call logs, contact list, text messages, microphone, and geolocation, take photos, and install new apps.",

            "Overview": "The Classiscam cybercrime operation has been ongoing since at least 2019. The scam-as-a-service affiliate program is aimed at stealing payment and personal data from users of known web marketplaces and classifieds through phishing schemes. Classiscam has been run by dozens of cybergangs, mostly of Russian origin, targeting the United States, the Middle East, Central Asia, and different European countries, such as France, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania.&nbsp;<div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">The Classiscam fraudsters can pose as both buyers and sellers. When acting as sellers, the threat actors publish advertisements on popular marketplaces and classifieds (e.g. Leboncoin, Allegro, OLX, FAN Courier, and Sbazar) promoting products at low prices. If the victims contact the fraudulent seller, they are encouraged to continue the conversation over a third-party messaging service, such as WhatsApp or Telegram, where they are asked for personal details (e.g. full name, address, and phone number). For Telegram communication, the scammers use Telegram bots for automated conversations. Then, the scammers employ a phishing kit for sending links to a fake popular courier service website (e.g. DHL or FedEx) or a fraudulent website impersonating a classified or a marketplace with a payment form. The victims enter their payment details which are directly transferred to the scammer. Sometimes, the victims are scammed twice when they are tricked by ‚Äútech supporters‚Äù into requesting a refund, but instead of being credited, they are getting charged again by the threat actors.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">When acting as buyers, the scammers contact random marketplace or classified sellers and use automated Telegram bots to generate a phishing page with the real name, photograph, and price of the goods. The phishing page includes a payment form asking for the seller‚Äôs bank card details in order to receive the payment.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">The Classiscam affiliate program consists of three primary elements: workers, communicating with the victims and sending the phishing URLs (earning 70-80% of the stolen sum); admins, responsible for recruiting new members, creating scam pages, establishing new accounts, and providing assistance in case of any payment issues (earning 20-30% of the stolen sum); and callers, pretending to be tech support specialists (earning 5-10% of the stolen sum).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">By the end of 2020, more than 5,000 scammers were registered to the Classiscam program on dedicated Telegram channels. It was estimated that each Classiscam cybergang earns around $61,000 per month, with around $522,000 for all the groups in total. One cybergang, Dreamer Money Gang (DMG), was observed earning around $3,000 a day.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">In August 2022, it was reported that the Classiscam operation has expanded to Singapore since March 2022. The attack infrastructure comprised over 200 phishing domains, out of which 18 were specifically created to target Singaporean classified users. Other fake websites impersonated marketplaces, banks, food and crypto brands, and delivery companies, in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "The following mitigation measures are recommended to avoid getting scammed:&nbsp;<div>- Check the URL requesting payment details, especially when it is received through a messaging platform. If the URL only exists for a short time, it is most probably a scam.&nbsp;</div><div>- Keep all seller communication in the official chat of the used platform, never moving to a third-party messaging service.&nbsp;</div><div>- Do not agree to prepaid transactions; only pay after the goods are received or there is reliable evidence of shipment.&nbsp;</div><div>- Be suspicious of unreasonable discounts and low prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",

            "Overview": "The CopperStealer malware (AKA Mingloa), first reported by Proofpoint researchers in March 2021, has been active since at least July 2019. It seems to be closely related to SilentFade, a Hong Kong-based malware that was first reported by Facebook in 2019. CopperStealer targets users of major service providers (including Apple, Amazon, Bing, Google, PayPal, Tumblr, and Twitter), especially in India, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The malware‚Äôs name originates from observed PDB and process memory strings referencing ‚ÄúDavidCopperfield.‚Äù <br/><br/>CopperStealer spreads through malicious websites promoting the download of fake software cracks. The malware‚Äôs binary is encrypted and appended to the downloaded executable, which is overwritten by a shellcode. The shellcode reads the XOR decryption key from the executable and leads to the deployment of a UPX-packed DLL dropper, containing two additional executables, a browser stealer and a remote desktop component. Once deployed, CopperStealer harvests web browser information, including cookies and login credentials. In addition, it steals user data from online messenger platforms, such as Telegram, Discord, and Elements, the Steam game distribution service, and email clients (e.g. Outlook and Thunderbird). The infostealer also retrieves the victims' User Access Token from Facebook, enabling it to gather the account‚Äôs friends list, advertisement information, and a list of Facebook pages with access permissions to the account. <br/><br/>The stolen information is compressed into a password-protected 7-Zip archive and exfiltrated to a dedicated Telegram channel that acts as a command and control (C2) server. CopperStealer‚Äôs C2 infrastructure initially relied on domain generation algorithms (DGA) to randomize its C2 domains and abused the content delivery network (CDN) proxy to conceal the actual IP address of the C2 server; however, newer malware versions seem to use an encrypted configuration of C2 domains, hosted on third-party web pages (e.g. Pastebin), and the fast flux DNS service for switching IP addresses. <br/><br/>CopperStealer‚Äôs remote desktop component supports two tasks, ‚Äúinstall‚Äù and ‚Äúkillme.‚Äù ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù enables the threat actors to add new user accounts to the compromised machine, establishes remote desktop connections, disables firewall and network level authentication (NLA), and more. ‚ÄúKillme‚Äù terminates the running processes, deletes files, and removes the users that were added as part of the ‚Äúinstall‚Äù task. The malware also embeds an anti-analysis mechanism preventing it from running in virtual environments.<br/><br/>In addition to information stealing, CopperStealer can also be used to fetch a download configuration from the C2 server that executes a legitimate download manager called Xunlei. Xunlei might be abused to download the configuration for additional malicious payloads, such as the Smokeloader backdoor. ",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In August 2022, Trend Micro researchers observed&nbsp;CopperStealer being distributed through fake crack websites as a malicious Chrome browser extension, creating and stealing API keys from infected machines when the victim logged into a major cryptocurrency exchange website. The API keys enabled the malicious extension to initiate transactions and send cryptocurrencies from the victims' accounts to attacker-controlled wallets.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

            "Overview": "The Andariel threat group (AKA Silent Chollima, Stonefly) has been active since at least 2009. The North Korean state-sponsored group, considered to be a subgroup of Lazarus, primarily targets South Korean government agencies and military organizations, as well as private organizations in the energy, finance, healthcare, media, and technology sectors. Andariel also targets other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Russia, China, Japan, India, Brazil, Germany, and Israel. The group‚Äôs targeting seems to reflect the national interests of the North Korean government. Andariel mostly focuses on cyberespionage, but since around 2015, has put more emphasis on financial-oriented campaigns targeting ATMs, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online gambling websites.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Andariel gains initial access through various methods, including spear phishing email messages with macro-embedded documents, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks. All of these methods eventually lead to the deployment of common backdoors such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, as well as custom backdoors such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. In addition, Andariel uses destructive malware (e.g. Crash.exe and Test.exe) to destroy hard disk contents and utility tools like Putty Link and port scanner for communication and reconnaissance purposes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Andariel was linked to several high-profile campaigns, including Operation Black Mine, that ran between May 2014 and June 2015 and targeted South Korean organizations in the energy, transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting, IT companies, finance, and political sectors. The threat actors distributed the Bmdoor malware, whose executables were disguised as work-related files, graduation albums, and invitations to alumni associations. In addition, the group hacked domestic websites distributing malware to the general public.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">The South Korea Financial Security Institute linked Andariel to a series of cyber campaigns referred to as the ‚ÄúCampaign Rifle‚Äù that were initiated between 2015 and the first half of 2017, targeting financial institutes, national defense organizations, large corporations, security companies, and others. The attacks, which included spear phishing, source code and code signing certificate theft, and the exfiltration of confidential documents, shared similar characteristics with the 2013 DarkSeoul campaigns targeting media, finance, and ISP companies.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Another high-profile campaign that was associated with Andariel was Operation GoldenAxe, running from June 2016 to May 2017 and targeting South Korean websites related to diplomacy, space aviation, labor, finance, and the unification with North Korea. The threat actors used watering hole techniques to spread malicious codes exploiting ActiveX vulnerabilities, in order to infiltrate systems and destroy hard disks.&nbsp;</span></div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In September 2019, the United States Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) proposed sanctions against three North Korean state-sponsored groups that were identified separately as the Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel. The sanctions included the confiscation of all properties and financial assets owned by the three groups in the United States and a prohibition of all dealings involving these properties and assets. In addition, the US government prohibited facilitating a significant transaction or providing financial services for any of the entities.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>In June 2021, Kaspersky researchers reported that Andariel initiated a campaign against South Korean entities in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors. The threat actors used spear phishing messages with weaponized documents to distribute backdoors and a custom ransomware encrypting files to exhort the victims paying a Bitcoin ransom.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In August 2022, the Maui ransomware operation was linked to Andariel with low to medium confidence. The link was made through an observed attack in April 2022 against a Japanese housing company. The attack also included the use of a DTrack malware variant and the 3Proxy server utility that was previously observed in various Andariel campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",

According to the threat actor, the malware was designed to be the most spotlighted and advanced Android Banking Trojan with new features (e.g. DDoS, man-in-the-middle attacks, two-factor authentication codes interception, and ransomware) to be released in the future, in addition to the existing features, including credential stealing, overlay attacks, keylogging, notification manipulation, and session cookies theft. In its current state, the malware appears as a collection of banking, cryptocurrency wallet, and shopping applications from the U.S. and Spain, but can be customized based on the buyer‚Äôs specifications and requests.",

The new malware version demonstrated an&nbsp;improved cookie stealing mechanism targeting a broad list of Google services (e.g.&nbsp;Gmail, GPay, and Google Password Manager) and other applications. In addition, the malware was added the ability to take screenshots, execute commands (e.g. screen click, swipe, and copy/paste), and prevent the uninstallation of the malicious app. Although the list of targeted apps was expanded, some malware samples removed the targeting of&nbsp;Russian and Ukraine apps. The cybersecurity researchers also detected an even newer S.O.V.A. version (v5), still under development, with&nbsp;ransomware capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

The ransomware was first seen distributed in isolated attacks at the end of December 2019. Over time, attacks slowly increased, until the end of June, when there was a sharp increase in the affected victims.<br/><br/>Security researchers suspect that this ransomware shares the same malware code as Ryuk ransomware (version 2 of Ryuk). In addition to similarities in the malware code, the Conti ransom note uses the same template as Ryuk‚Äôs ransom note. Moreover, a security researcher has seen the same TrickBot infrastructure being used by both Ryuk and the Conti threat actors as part of ransomware attacks.<br/><br/>The Conti operators breach corporate networks and move laterally until they gain domain admin credentials. Once administrative privileges are achieved, the threat actors deploy the ransomware to encrypt drives and installed devices. <br/><br/>The group follows the \"double extortion\" approach, of not only encrypting the victims' files, but also stealing them and threatening to publish their contents on their leak site in case the ransom demand is not met. Conti encrypts user data using the AES-256 algorithm and then uses the RSA-4096 algorithm to encrypt the AES keys. Its ransom demand is in BTC.<br/><br/>In August 2020, the threat actors behind the Conti ransomware opened a designated leak site, one of the signs of the hybrid attack (aka double extortion). After infiltrating the system, they first steal the data on the compromised system and then encrypt it. If the victims do not pay the ransom demand, the attackers release the stolen data. On its opening day, the site already listed 26 companies that had fallen victim to the group's attacks and have declined to pay the ransom. For each company listed on the site, the group has leaked documents obtained from their networks, as proof of their hack.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In September 2020, Conti operators attacked the Fourth District Court of Louisiana and published proof of the attack on its dark web page.<br><br>In January 2021, The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) reported that some of its contact centers, internal systems, processes, and internal communications were affected following a ransomware attack that took place on Christmas Eve. SEPA added that after isolating the compromised systems, recovery will probably take \"a significant period\" and some of the infected SEPA systems will have to be replaced with new ones. While SEPA did not attribute the attack to any specific ransomware operation, the Conti ransomware gang claims the attack and has already published 7% of the stolen data on its leak site. According to SEPA, roughly 1.2 GB of data was exfiltrated during the attack, with evidence showing that at least 4,000 files were probably accessed and stolen. The information stolen by the Conti operators during the attack included business information, such as publicly available regulated site permits, authorizations, and enforcement notices, information related to SEPA corporate plans, priorities, and change programs, procurement information, such as publicly available procurement awards, project information related to commercial work with international partners, and SEPA's staff personal information.<br><br>In May 2021, Conti initiated a vast ransomware attack against Ireland's national health services provider (Health Service Executive), encrypting computers and severely disrupting the healthcare services in the country for nearly two months.<br><br>In August 2021, cybersecurity researchers reported that Conti leveraged ProxyShell vulnerabilities to hack Microsoft Exchange servers. During this campaign, the threat actor used various tools to achieve remote access to the infected devices, such as Anydesk and Cobalt Strike beacons.<br><br>In September 2021, Ireland‚Äôs cybercrime police initiated an operation targeting the IT infrastructure of a threat actor, assumed to be Conti. As part of the operation, the police seized several domains used in the attack performed four months earlier. However, later that month, GSS, the Spanish and Latin America division of Europe's largest call center provider - Covisian, reported on a ransomware attack conducted by Conti that shut down its IT systems and affected call centers across its Spanish-speaking customers. Among other affected services were: Vodafone Spain, the Masmovil ISP, and television stations. In addition, a few days later, Advanced Intelligence researchers reported that the threat actor is developing new methods to destroy backups, specifically the Veaam recovery software. In a campaign conducted in 2021, Conti was observed to install Cobalt Strike beacon backdoor through spam messages, impersonate privileged backup users in order to get Veeam backup privileges, exfiltrate Veeam backups using Rclone, and then manually remove the backups. At the end of that month, JVCKenwood, a Japan-based multinational electronics company, reported another ransomware attack conducted by Conti on September 22nd, targeting the servers of its European sales companies. The threat actor claimed to have stolen 1.5 TB of files and demanded a ransom of seven million dollars.<br><br>In October 2021, Sandhills Global, an American information processing company, suffered a ransomware attack attributed to Conti. As a result, the company‚Äôs website, all of their hosted publications, and their phones went offline. It is still unknown whether data was stolen during the attack.<br><br>Later that month, it was published that the Conti operators started to sell access to their victims' networks in their shaming blog, where they add organizations that refuse ransom negotiations. In another reported incident that occurred that month, Conti attacked the high society jeweler \"Graff,\" demanding millions as a ransom payment. The threat actor already leaked 69 thousand documents, including customer lists, invoices, receipts, and credit notes, some of which belong to high profile figures, such as David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, and Donald Trump.<br><br>IBM X-Force reported that since July 2021 TA551 (AKA Shatak) partnered with the TrickBot developers to create phishing campaigns and eventually deploy Conti ransomware on targeted systems. The phishing email messages contained malicious attachments with a script that installs either TrickBot or BazarBackdoor. Then, a Cobalt Strike beacon was deployed before dropping the Conti ransomware. The Conti operators then took over to steal credentials, system directory information, and other valuable data before encrypting the files on the victims' networks. The campaigns focused on European countries, such as Germany, Slovakia, and the Netherlands.<br><br>In November 2021, researchers observed a new partnership between the Emotet botnet operators and the Conti group. Ryuk, Conti's predecessor, already used Emotet as part of its infrastructure. However, it was reported that Conti is also expected to start delivering its payload via Emotet.  <br><br>Also in the same month, the Prodaft research team reported on Conti's money operation. The researchers analyzed the group's Bitcoin wallets and reported that between July and November 2021, Conti earned at least 25.5 million dollars in ransom payments. In addition, the research shed light on the Conti affiliates' money-laundering operation. In order to evade law enforcement activity, the threat actors use various services, such as exchanges, coin swaps, privacy enhancing wallets (e.g. Wasabi), and the darknet marketplace Hydra.<br>The researchers also revealed verified IP addresses used in the group's operations and three Conti recruiters, which are active on hacking forums. They discovered a vulnerability in the recovery servers that Conti uses and leveraged it in order to discover the real IP addresses of the hosting provider of the group‚Äôs recovery website. This turned out to be the Ukrainian web hosting company ITL LLC.<br><br>On December 7, 2021, the Norwegian Nordic Choice Hotels confirmed that they were breached by Conti. The incident disrupted the hotel's guest reservation and room key card systems. In addition, some of the guests' booking information may have been leaked, including their names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and any other information the guests may have provided. To date the ransomware operators have not published a ransom demand, however the hotel chain representatives already stated they will not negotiate with them.<br><br>On December 10, 2021, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) published a report warning against the Conti group, after it attacked multiple Australian organizations from various sectors during November and December 2021. The ACSC mentioned that TrickBot and Cobalt Strike were deployed upon the victims' networks before the Conti ransomware strain. The report was published following the attack against the Australian electricity provider CS Energy at the end of November.<br><br>On December 12, 2021, Conti breached ‚Äãthe McMenamins restaurant and hotel chain. The group encrypted servers and workstations, causing the company to shut down its IT systems, credit card point-of-sale systems, and corporate email. The company stated that it is possible that employee data was leaked, such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, SSNs, and bank account information. It is uncertain whether customer information was also compromised.<br><br>On December 17, 2021, it was reported that Conti started to leverage the critical Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), in order to get initial access to internal VMware vCenter servers and encrypt virtual machines. This attack vector is different from the group's usual infiltration method, which is phishing email messages.<br><br>The compromise of VMware vCenter servers adds to the existing Conti attack chain, which includes the use of Emotet and Cobalt Strike to gain system access and establish persistence, and Kerberoasting and brute-forcing to acquire user credentials and elevate admin privileges.<br><br>On December 27, 2021, it was reported that Shutterfly suffered a Conti ransomware attack that occurred two weeks earlier. The group claimed to encrypt over 4,000 devices and 120 VMware ESXi servers, demanding millions of dollars as a ransom payment. Some of the stolen data were uploaded to Conti's leak site, including legal agreements, bank and merchant account info, and user credentials. It was also suspected that customer information was leaked, including credit card information, but the company denied storing this kind of data. In addition, Conti claimed that they acquired the source code for Shutterfly's store. Shutterfly confirmed the breach and stated that it disrupted their services and the services of some of their brands, such as Lifetouch and Groovebook.<br><br>On January 19, 2022, RR Donnelly (RRD) confirmed that they were breached by Conti a month earlier. The company representatives stated that they were forced to shut down their network to prevent the attack from spreading, which caused some disruptions among customers. The threat actors leaked 2.5 GB of stolen company data and published it on their leak site, however soon removed it. It was not disclosed what was the ransom demand and whether the company agreed to it.<br><br>On January 20, 2022, Bank Indonesia (BI) admitted that it suffered a ransomware attack in December, in which data of employees was stolen. Although the bank did not attribute the attack to any specific threat actor, the Conti operators claimed responsibility, uploading some of the stolen files to their leak site. The threat actors threatened to leak 13.88 GB of documents in case the bank does not pay the ransom. The bank representatives stated that the attack was stopped before affecting its public services and that the stolen data was not critical.<br><br>On January 27, 2022, it was reported that Conti attacked Delta Electronics, a Taiwanese electronics company and a contractor for Apple, Tesla, HP, and Dell. The company that disclosed the attack five days earlier, stated that it had no significant impact on its operations, although the company's website was still down one week after the attack. The Conti operators claimed that they encrypted 1,500 servers and 12,000 computers on Delta Electronics' network and demanded a 15 million dollar ransom. The group was reported to leverage Cobalt Strike with Atera for achieving network persistence.<br><br>On February 2, 2022, KP Snacks, the British food producer, disclosed a ransomware attack that was attributed to Conti. The attack impacted the company‚Äôs operations and caused delays and cancellations in product deliveries to supermarkets.

The threat actors gained access to the personal information of employees, including names, physical addresses, SSNs, medical records, ID and passport numbers, and driver's licenses. Conti published 2% of the allegedly stolen data on November 7, 2021, however, did not publish the remaining 98%. The reason may be the start of ransom negotiations with the company or just loss of interest.<br><br>On February 25, 2022, Conti announced its support for the Russian government's attack on Ukraine. In addition, the threat actors threatened to attack the critical infrastructure of countries acting against Russia. In response, a Ukrainian security researcher leaked over 60,000 internal messages belonging to the Conti ransomware operation.  The messages included information about the shutdown of the TrickBot operation, conversations about the Diavol ransomware operation, and 239 bitcoin addresses containing $13 million in payments. The leaks were dubbed in the cyber community \"Conti Leaks.\"<br><br>On March 1, 2022, other details involving the Conti operation were leaked, including the source code for Conti Locker v2 and a decryptor that only works on older victims. In addition, the leak included other group members' chats and training materials mentioning hacking tools, such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, AnyDesk, and Mimikatz, and the following TTPs:<br>- Active Directory Enumeration.<br>- SQL Databases Enumeration via sqlcmd.<br>- How to gain access to Shadow Protect SPX (StorageCraft) backups.<br>- How to create NTDS dumps vs vssadmin.<br>- How to open New RDP Port 1350.<br><br>On March 9, 2022, CISA published an alert about Conti, and provided indicators of compromise (IoCs) including approximately 100 domain names that are used by the group (added to this term). The agency mentioned that Conti has attacked more than 1,000 organizations around the world, primarily using Cobalt Strike and Trickbot as part of its attack vector.<br><br>On March 11, 2022, Check Point researchers provided additional details about Conti's internal operations. They mentioned that Conti is structured like a high-tech company, with arranged management, finance, and HR functions. In addition, the group hires people from legitimate sources, with some of them not even knowing that they are part of the Conti operation. The group has physical offices in Russia and other locations, headed by an entity named Stern. The researchers also revealed chatters discussing Conti's future plans to create a private crypto exchange system and establish a darknet social network.<br><br>On March 20, 2022, the Conti Leaks continued with the publishing of the source code for Conti version 3. The source code was released in a Visual Studio file, enabling any user with access to compile the ransomware locker and decryptor.<br><br>On April 7, 2022, the American automotive tools manufacturer Snap-on confirmed that it suffered a data breach at the beginning of March 2022, later claimed by Conti. The threat actors started to leak files out of the 1 GB of data that was allegedly stolen from the company, including personal employee data. However, they quickly removed the data leak, which may indicate that the company paid the ransom. <br><br>On April 14, 2022, Conti claimed responsibility for the attack against Nordex Group, one of the world‚Äôs largest manufacturers of wind turbines. The company confirmed that it was hit by a cyberattack, forcing it to shut down IT systems across multiple locations and business units. Although Conti opened an entry for Nordex on its leak site, it has not yet leaked any data, indicating that the company may be negotiating with the threat actors or that no data was stolen in the attack.<br><br>On April 15, 2022, researchers from different cybersecurity vendors established a link between the Karakurt extortion group and Conti. The researchers gained access to an internal Conti VPS server and discovered that the groups share the same infrastructure and victims. In addition, it was found that Karakurt transferred payments from victims to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by Conti.<br><br>On May 6, 2022, the United States Department of State published a statement in which it offered rewards of up to $10,000,000 for information about Conti‚Äôs leaders and up to $5,000,000 for information about any member of the Conti operation. The rewards were offered as part of the Department of State's Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP) aiming to ‚Äúdisrupt and dismantle transnational organized crime globally, including cybercrime.‚Äù  <br><br>On May 7, 2022, Conti announced that it breached the Peru MOF ‚Äì Direcci√≥n General de Inteligencia (DIGIMIN), the premier intelligence agency in Peru. The group claimed to steal 9.41 GB of data and published it on its leak site.  <br><br>On May 8, 2022, Costa Rica declared a national emergency after Conti attacked different government entities, such as the Costa Rican Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology, and Telecommunications. The threat actors claimed to steal 672 GB of data, which they leaked following the government's refusal to pay the ransom. Conti even threatened to \"overthrow\" the new government of the country. The group raised its ransom demand to $20 million and stated it will delete the decryption keys in a week if the ransom demands are not met. The attack against the Costa Rican government was attributed to an affiliate actor dubbed \"UNC1756.\" <br><br>On May 13, 2022, the  Parker-Hannifin Corporation confirmed that it was breached by Conti two months earlier. The threat actors gained unauthorized access to Parker's computer systems and stole employees' personal information, including names, SSNs, addresses, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, financial information, user credentials, and health insurance details. Conti already leaked the stolen data (419 GB), which may indicate that the ransom negotiations with the company had failed. <br><br>On May 19, 2022, it was reported that Conti shut down its operation, taking some of its infrastructure offline. While the group's leak site remained active, the Tor admin panels that were used for ransom negotiations were taken down, as well as other internal services. It was assumed that the Conti members migrated to smaller ransomware operations, including semi-autonomous groups, loyal to Conti, such as ALPHV (AKA BlackCat), Hive, and AvosLocker, and autonomous data exfiltration groups, such as Karakurt, BlackBasta, and BlackByte. All were reported to be part of the Conti cybercrime syndicate that no longer operates under the Conti name. In addition, cybersecurity researchers assumed that the reported \"war\" between Conti and the Costa Rican government was only a facade of a live operation to obscure the slow migration of the group's members to other threat groups.<br><br>On June 2, 2022, cybersecurity researchers, investigating the leaked Conti chats, reported that members of Conti actively developed firmware hacks. Specifically, Conti created a proof-of-concept (PoC) code that leveraged Intel‚Äôs Management Engine (ME) to overwrite the flash memory hosting UEFI/BIOS firmware and gain System Management Mode (SMM) execution with the highest possible system privileges while evading all the available security mechanisms.  <br><br>On June 22, 2022, it was reported that Conti shut down its two last Tor servers that were used to leak victims' data, presumably putting an end to the operations bearing its name.          <br><br>On June 23, 2022, Group-IB researchers reported on a Conti campaign, dubbed ARMattack, that took place between November 17 and December 20, 2021. In the course of the campaign, the group compromised more than 40 organizations from multiple sectors around the world (primarily in the United States), encrypting their files and stealing sensitive documents. It was not disclosed whether any of the victims paid the ransom demands.<br>      <br>On August 10, 2022, AdvIntel researchers reported three groups that split from Conti and use BazaCall phishing attacks (AKA BazarCall) primarily targeting the&nbsp;finance, technology, legal, and insurance sectors. The groups,&nbsp;Silent Ransom (AKA Luna Moth), Quantum, and Roy/Zeon, used&nbsp;call-back phishing as an initial access vector to breach targeted networks. The threat actors sent their victims email messages with a phone number for canceling some subscriptions; however, once the victims called the number they were tricked into granting the attackers&nbsp;remote desktop control.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span><div><div><br></div><div>On August 11, 2022, the United States&nbsp;State Department announced up to $10 million for information regarding five high-ranking Conti members, nicknamed \"Target\" (office manager and team leader for Ryuk/Conti), \"Tramp\" (the owner/leader of BlackBasta), \"Dandis,\" \"Professor,\" and \"Reshaev.\" The US government also published a picture of the Conti associate known as \"Target.\"<div><br><div><br>Disclaimer: on the IOCs section are detailed domains and IP addresses that security researchers related to Conti's activity.

            "Overview": "The RedAlpha threat group (AKA DeepCliff, Red Dev 3) has been active since at least 2015. The Chinese, likely to be state-sponsored, cyberespionage group primarily targets humanitarian agencies, think tanks, social movements, media groups, and government organizations belonging to Chinese ethnic and religious minorities (e.g. Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Falun Gong) in China and abroad. In addition, RedAlpha targets defense and government organizations in South and Southeast Asia, in countries such as Taiwan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Thailand.<br/><br/>RedAlpha usually compromises victims through phishing email messages containing PDF files with malicious links leading to credential harvesting domains. The group uses hundreds of different domains impersonating major email clients (e.g. Yahoo, Outlook, and Zimbra), cloud service providers (e.g. Google and Microsoft), and known government, media, and humanitarian organizations and think tanks, such as the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), Amnesty International, the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), Radio Free Asia (RFA), the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). The harvested credentials are used to gain access to the targets‚Äô email accounts and other communication platforms, in order to gather valuable information. In addition, RedAlpha was observed exploiting known Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2017-0199) and deploying various backdoors and infostealers, such as njRAT, NetHelp Striker, and other commodity and custom malware.      <br/><br/>Cybersecurity researchers linked RedAlpha to a Chinese information security company called Nanjing Qinglan Information Technology Co., Ltd. (later known as Jiangsu Cimer Information Security Technology Co. Ltd.), which appears to be the registrant of multiple RedAlpha domains. In addition, RedAlpha‚Äôs tools and infrastructure were linked to other threat groups, such as NetTraveler, Icefog, and DeputyDog.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;",

            "Overview": "APT-C-35 (aka DoNot Team, Donot Team, or Sector E02) is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, assumed to be state-sponsored by the government of India. Even though the group was first reported by 360 Core Security Team in mid-2017, there is evidence that they have been operating since April 2016, maybe even earlier. APT-C-35 orchestrated attacks mainly against South Asian entities, predominantly in Pakistan, but was also observed operating in Argentina, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. They usually engage in cyber espionage, to obtain valuable information from government and military officials, and have also been observed targeting Kashmiri non-profit organizations.<br/><br/>The threat actor uses cybersquatting techniques to register domains that resemble legitimate applications, companies, and services, like Adobe and Gmail (e.g. adobeupdater.com), but in fact contain bait files and malicious APKs. The group also uses spear-phishing emails with Microsoft Office attachments containing either a vulnerability or malicious macro code.<br/><br/>In January 2018, cybersecurity researchers detected a new modular/plugin-based malware framework presumably used by the group, dubbed ‚Äúyty.‚Äù The malware code was similar to the EHDevel malware reported by Bitdefender in 2017, which itself bore similarities to malware used in Operation Hangover in 2010-2013 and attributed to the Indian APT Patchwork. There is no conclusive evidence of collaboration between the two groups. <br/><br/>Malware variants of the yty framework that evolved over time include Jaca, Gedit, and DarkMusical.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In August 2018, it was reported on a spear-phishing campaign against entities in the Kashmir region. In the campaign that was active from July 2017, the group used either emails or SMSs to lure their victims into downloading malicious applications disguised as locally known service providers (e.g. KNS Lite - Kashmir News Service).<br><br>In March 2019, researchers discovered a credentials stealing campaign attributed to the group, targeting mostly South Asian governments. In the campaign, dubbed ‚ÄúLucky Elephant,‚Äù the attackers used websites that imitated South Asian government entities, such as the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bangladesh Air Force as well as Microsoft Outlook 365 login pages hosted on cybersquatted domains. The researchers suspected that phishing emails were used to deceive victims into providing their credentials. A fairly similar campaign was detected around that time by the ThreatRecon team, that targeted the Government of Pakistan and Pakistani defense and intelligence organizations. The campaign was initiated with spear-phishing emails that contained malicious Excel files. <br><br>In April 2019, a research team reported another APT-C-35 attack against Pakistani entities, this time using an Android APK framework, dubbed ‚ÄúStealJob.‚Äù The attack vector included the use of decoy malicious applications planted in dedicated websites.  <br><br>In November 2019, Positive Technologies detected an ongoing spear-phishing campaign mainly against countries in South Asia (e.g. Bangladesh, Thailand, and the Philippines), but also in the United Kingdom, Argentina, and the United Arab Emirates. The phishing emails contained Microsoft Word RTF documents that exploited the CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability in Microsoft Equation. In this campaign, the researchers noticed that the management servers were leased from the provider ‚ÄúDigitalOcean, LLC‚Äù and located in Amsterdam. In addition, the attackers did not use the same servers for different DNS names.<br><br>In September 2020, cybersecurity researchers followed Twitter reports from earlier that year (May and June 2021) to find new malware samples linked to the group‚Äôs malicious mobile application infrastructure. In their investigation, the researchers learned that the group has developed better antivirus evasion techniques, as most of their previously plaintext strings were now Base64-encoded. In addition, they uncovered a relatively unique group feature: Most of the Android packages in its operations communicated to a certain domain (www.geoip-db.com) to acquire geolocation information and victim‚Äôs external IP address, rather than relying on internal Android functions to obtain this information.   <br><br>In October 2020, an intelligence team observed a new campaign, in which the group started to use a new Android loader, dubbed ‚ÄúFirestarter.‚Äù The malware abuses Google‚Äôs Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) server for command-and-control (C2) communication, in order to avoid detection. It was executed through malicious APK files (e.g. kashmir_Voice_v4.8.apk), and likely spread through direct messages. The campaign targeted mainly end users and non-profit organizations connected to the Kashmir area (India and Pakistan).  <br><br>In April 2021, researchers analyzed malicious Android applications that were published in a Twitter post in relation to the group. They found that all the apps lead to a fake application package masquerading as a legitimate Google update application (com.update.gooqle).<br><br>In October 2021, Amnesty International linked the group to a spyware attack against a Togolese activist in December 2019-January 2020, during the 2020 Togolese presidential election period. The Android spyware was first distributed through a WhatsApp message, soliciting the installation of a chat app called ‚ÄúChatLite.‚Äù However, as this distribution method failed, the attackers used an email sent from a Gmail account, containing a Microsoft Word file leveraging a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to drop the spyware. The spyware featured various capabilities, such as keylogging, taking screenshots, and stealing files. In addition, the spyware was traced back to an Indian cybersecurity company ‚ÄúInnefu Labs,‚Äù which denied any connection to the group. Due to the unusual location of the attack, it is possible that the group started to offer 'hacker for hire' services to governments.  <br><br>In November 2021, APT-C-35 was reported as one of three APT groups using a novel RTF template injection technique, as part of their phishing campaigns. This technique enabled them to retrieve malicious content from a remote URL using RTF files. The RTF files are also less detected by security software.<div><br></div><div>In August 2022, Morphisec researchers reported that APT-C-35 upgraded its Windows malware framework (YTY, Jaca) to include an improved infostealer module, designed to steal&nbsp;information from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. In addition, the framework included other modules, which were downloaded from a remote C2 server and could be used to log user keystrokes, take screenshots, upload and exfiltrate files, steal removable disk files, and launch a reverse shell for granting&nbsp;remote access to the victim's machine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MITRE ATT&amp;CK¬Æ TTPs:<br><br>Initial Access<br>T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment<br><br>Execution<br>T1059 - Command-Line Interface<br>T1053 - Scheduled Task<br>T1064 - Scripting<br>T1204 - User Execution<br><br>Persistence<br>T1158 - Hidden Files and Directories<br>T1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder<br>T1053 - Scheduled Task<br><br>Defense Evasion<br>T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information<br>T1107 - File Deletion<br>T1158 - Hidden Files and Directories<br>T1066 - Indicator Removal from Tools<br>T1112 - Modify Registry<br>T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information<br>T1064 - Scripting<br><br>Credential Access<br>T1056 - Input Capture<br><br>Discovery<br>T1010 - Application Window Discovery<br>T1083 - File and Directory Discovery<br>T1082 - System Information Discovery<br>T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion<br><br>Collection<br>T1119 - Automated Collection<br>T1005 - Data from Local System<br>T1039 - Data from Network Shared Drive<br>T1025 - Data from Removable Media<br>T1074 - Data Staged<br>T1114 - Email Collection<br>T1056 - Input Capture<br>T1113 - Screen Capture<br><br>Command and Control<br>T1043 - Commonly Used Port<br>T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol<br><br>Exfiltration<br>T1020 - Automated Exfiltration<br>T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel</div>",

            "Overview": "The Grandoreiro banking Trojan was first observed in 2016. The malware, operating in the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, targets banking customers and organizations in the automotive, civil and industrial construction, logistics, and machinery sectors, primarily located in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, and Portugal. Kaspersky tracks Grandoreiro as part of a collective of four Brazilian-based banking Trojan families, Tetrade, which also includes Guildma, Javali, and Melcoz (AKA Mekotio).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Grandoreiro, written in Delphi, usually spreads through malspam campaigns, in which phishing email messages using lures (e.g. COVID-19) or impersonating a legitimate entity (e.g. tax authorities or government entities) are sent to the victims exhorting them to click on attached links. These links lead the targets to malicious websites that promote web browser plugins or fake Flash/Java updates, which then download VBS (sometimes MSI) installers. The installers, often stored on public online sharing services (e.g. GitHub), execute the Grandoreiro payload, which is usually archived in a ZIP file. Sometimes, the malware operators use Google ads to distribute their malicious loaders.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once deployed, Grandoreiro establishes connection to a remote command and control (C2) server, using the RealThinClient SDK, and starts collecting data, such as system information (e.g. computer name, username, and OS version), clipboard data, cryptocurrency information, and web browser data. The malware can access the browsers‚Äô history and steal cookies and user credentials for banking accounts to make fraudulent money transactions. In addition, Grandoreiro can perform overlay attacks, log user keystrokes, simulate mouse and keyboard actions, manipulate windows, block access to specific websites, log the victim out of the system, and restart the machine. The malware establishes persistence by creating an LNK file in the Windows startup directory. To evade detection, Grandoreiro disables banking protection software (e.g. Diebold Warsaw) and terminates running processes that might interfere with its operation. In addition, it uses the binary padding technique to avoid sandbox analysis. The C2 address is hidden using a domain generation algorithm (DGA).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In July 2021, the Spanish police arrested 16 individuals suspected of stealing and laundering funds using the Mekotio and Grandoreiro banking Trojans. According to the authorities, the suspects stole more than ‚Ç¨275,000 from compromised bank accounts and had access to other accounts storing around ‚Ç¨3.5 million that were yet to be diverted.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

            "Overview": "The TA558 threat group, first reported by Proofpoint researchers in August 2022, has been active since at least 2018. The financially-motivated group targets hospitality, hotel, and travel organizations, primarily located in Latin America, but also in North America and Western Europe. The activities of TA558 have intensified in 2022, probably due to the renaissance of tourism following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>TA558 distributes its malware using phishing email messages with reservation-themed lures, such as hotel bookings. The messages either contain documents with malicious macro codes or Microsoft Office exploits (e.g. CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2017-8570) or with URLs that lead to a booking-themed ISO file (sometimes hosted on compromised hotel websites), which then launches a PowerShell script. Both infection vectors eventually end with the deployment of 15 different malware families, such as Loda, Vjw0rm, AsyncRAT, and Revenge RAT, that achieve persistence by creating a scheduled task.

            "Overview": "The XCSSET malware family was first discovered by security researchers from TrendMicro in August 2020. XCSSET is a malicious code infection on the macOS integrated development environment (IDE) framework, Xcode, that can distribute malicious payloads. The researchers discovered two zero-day exploits on affected systems with the XCSSET code. One is used to steal cookies via a flaw in the behavior of Data Vaults and the other to abuse the development version of Safari. The malware can hijack Safari and inject various Javascript payloads.<div><br>Once a local Xcode project development framework is infected with the malicious code, the code will run on the project. Infection on Xcode could lead to a supply-chain attack and allows attackers to control the victim machine once that machine is injected with the XCSSET malware. Affected developers distribute the Trojan to users in the form of compromised Xcode projects or applications shared on GitHub, which could escalate the distribution of the malware.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>According to the report, two Xcode projects distributing the malware have been found, as well as 380 IP addresses of users infected with XCSSET. Out of them, 152 were located in China followed by 103 victims from India.</div><div><br></div><div>XCCSET has a wide variety of payload modules that attackers can perform on infected systems. The&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">XCCSET payload modules are capable of exploiting Safari and other installed browsers. The malware can read and dump Safari cookies from macOS‚Äôs Data Vaults and has a module that can use Safari development mode to inject JS backdoors. Moreover, XCSSET contains modules that can exfiltrate files from the infected system and can steal information from users' applications, such as Notes, Evernote, QQ, Skype, Telegram, and WeChat. In addition, XCSSET contains modules that can take screenshots of the victim‚Äôs current screen and visited websites, as well as ransomware modules.</span></div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "<div>In April 2021, TrendMicro researchers reported that&nbsp;XCSSET was adapted to&nbsp;work on both ARM64 and x86_x64 Macs and could fit macOS 11 Big Sur. The malware was observed masquerading as legitimate&nbsp;Big Sur to trick victims into downloading it to their computers. The updated malware could also bypass&nbsp;macOS 11's security policies and steal confidential data from websites, such as 163.com, Huobi, binance.com, nncall.net, Envato, and login.live.com.</div><div><br></div>In August 2022,&nbsp;SentinelOne researchers reported that the&nbsp;XCSSET operators increased their activity since May 2022 and updated the malware to support&nbsp;macOS Monterey by upgrading its source code components to Python 3. Besides using&nbsp;AppleScripts to steal web browser and chat apps' data, the malware was observed abusing a public Github repository, DockUtil, and leveraging Python scripts to drop fake application icons on the macOS Dock and steal data from users' Notes app.&nbsp;",

            "Overview": "The BlueSky ransomware group was first observed by cybersecurity researchers in June 2022. There is little information about the group‚Äôs specific targets.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>BlueSky usually gains initial system access either through malicious websites, which promote Trojanized cracks and keygens (some also host other malware), or through email messages with malicious attachments. Some infection cycles include the use of third-party frameworks, such as Cobalt Strike and Brute Ratel C4 (BRc4). The ransomware is downloaded and executed by a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that escalates privileges by exploiting known system vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2021-1732 or CVE-2022-21882) or by using the JuicyPotato local privilege escalation tool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The BlueSky ransomware payload is saved locally on the disk while masquerading as a legitimate Windows application (javaw.exe). The payload embeds multiple anti-analysis techniques, including string encryption, API obfuscation using DJB hashing functions, and anti-debugging mechanisms. BlueSky was observed leveraging NtSetInformationThread to hide threads that are launched by the malware executable. Then, BlueSky moves laterally in the system through Server Message Block (SMB) and starts encrypting files using the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm along with Curve25519 for key generation. The ransomware uses multithreading for faster encryption and, to thwart analysis, sometimes sleeps between each remote connection attempt. Unlike other ransomware that target specific file extensions to encrypt, BlueSky lists file types to be excluded from encryption (e.g. LDF, SCR, CMD, and BIN). Once encrypted, the files are appended with the .bluesky extension, and a ransom note (# DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #) is dropped in both TXT and HTML formats. The ransom notes include a general notice about the encryption and a link to a Tor payment website along with a unique recovery ID. The victims are given seven days to pay the ransom demand or the ransom amount is doubled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Security researchers found code similarities between the multithreaded architecture of BlueSky and Conti‚Äôs v3 ransomware strain; however, the groups apply different encryption algorithms. In addition, some of BlueSky‚Äôs domain infrastructure was found to have originated from Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",

The campaign has targeted over 100 organizations from various sectors, such as IT, telecommunications, finance, education, and retail. Most of the victims are located in the United States and are customers of the identity services provider, Okta. The threat actor behind this campaign was dubbed by Okta \"Scatter Swine.\"&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;</div><div>On August 7, 2022, the cloud communications company, Twilio, disclosed a data breach following an SMS phishing attack (smishing) against its employees. The threat actors, whose identity was not disclosed, impersonated Twilio's IT department to steal employee credentials that they used to gain unauthorized access to the data of at least 125 customers. In addition, the breach affected Signal users, exposing the registered phone numbers of 1,900 accounts. Twilio revoked the compromised employee credentials, but not before the damage was done. Further investigation by Twilio uncovered that the attackers managed to breach 93 Authy user accounts and they registered unauthorized devices to these accounts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On August 9, 2022, it was revealed that the same modus operandi was used to breach Cloudflare employees' accounts; however, unlike the Twilio incident, the threat actors failed to access the company systems, as they could not acquire their victims' company-issued security keys.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>On August 25, 2022, Group-IB researchers reported the incidents were part of a larger campaign that has already compromised around 10,000 accounts belonging to employees of 130 organizations around the world. The campaign operators sought to obtain Okta identity credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens, and one-time passwords (OTPs), using over 150 unique phishing domains impersonating the Okta authentication page. The stolen credentials could later be used to access and gather sensitive information from corporate VPNs, networks, and internal customer support systems of the targeted organizations using remote access software (e.g. AnyDesk). Stolen customer data was observed being used for performing supply-chain attacks against other companies (e.g. DigitalOcean and Signal).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The campaign was also linked to other data breaches, including that of the food delivery service DoorDash, the marketing firm Klaviyo, and the email client Mailchimp. In those breaches, the threat actors used stolen credentials to compromise customer information, including names, email and physical addresses, phone numbers, and even credit card information in a small number of cases.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The security researchers were able to connect the phishing kit that has been used in the campaign to a Telegram channel, set for dropping compromised data. In addition, the Telegram channel was found to be managed by a 22 year-old software developer, ‚ÄúSubject X,‚Äù based in North Carolina.&nbsp;</div>",

The open-source red team toolkit (freely available on GitHub) is used by organizations to perform security testing; however, threat actors have adopted it for malicious purposes in numerous campaigns targeting organizations from multiple sectors and countries.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sliver, written in Golang, is utilized by threat actors to gain an initial foothold, maintain system access, deliver additional payloads (e.g. ransomware), scan for system vulnerabilities (e.g. Log4j), and enable lateral movement (through PsExec). It is delivered through various methods, such as weaponized attachments in email messages or compromised websites and malware loaders (e.g. Bumblebee). The toolkit supports the major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and multiple protocols (DNS, HTTP/TLS, MTLS, TCP).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sliver accepts C2 connections from implants on compromised systems and enables the C2 operators to interact with the implants and execute arbitrary commands. In addition, it can host files to emulate a legitimate web server and generate implants in several formats (e.g. shellcode, executable, and DLL). Like other C2 frameworks (e.g. Cobalt Strike), Sliver runs many process injection commands, such as loading and running DLLs and .NET assemblies, injecting a Metasploit framework, and migrating into a remote process. Yet, Sliver offers more customization in terms of payload delivery compared to other similar frameworks, a trait that enables it to evade detection. Sometimes, it is being delivered along with other such frameworks and malware, such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, IcedID, PupyRAT, and Pantegana.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since December 2020, there has been an uptick in the use of Sliver by threat actors, such as APT29 (AKA Cozy Bear), FIN12, and TA551 (AKA Shathak).&nbsp;</div>",

            "Overview": "The APT40 has been active since at least 2013. The Chinese state-sponsored group conducts cyber espionage campaigns against multiple sectors including defense, education, government, etc. It targets the United States, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia countries.<br><br>In 2017, campaigns started with spear phishing emails with themes such as ‚ÄúApplication for an internship‚Äù, ‚Äúresume‚Äù, ‚Äúrelevant research,‚Äù and others. The emails contained malicious attachments that exploited several vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-8759, CVE-2017-0199, and CVE-2017-11882. All of these are Microsoft Office vulnerabilities that allow remote access execution. The group quickly developed the exploits for those vulnerabilities which were disclosed only a few days before the attack. Besides spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities, the group also develops web shells for initial access.<br><br>After the exploitation, several backdoors were downloaded to the victim networks. One of them, NanHaiShu, leverages Javascript libraries and has the ability to gather information on the computer and execute other JavaScript. A similar tool called Orz can also overwrite registry settings in order to avoid detection, execute shell commands, etc.<br>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "<div>According to security researchers, between 2018-2019, the group was involved in targeting and monitoring the elections of countries that neighbor China.<br><br>On February 5, 2020, Malaysia‚Äôs CERT (MyCERT) announced that a Chinese threat group has been targeting Malaysian government officials. The threat actor behind that campaign is most likely APT40, due to the tools and the TTPs used in the attacks. The purpose of the attacks was to infect the computers of government officials in Malaysia with malware and to steal confidential documents.&nbsp;The threat actors, pretending to be journalists and representatives of a military organization and a non-governmental organization (NGO), infiltrated the network using spear-phishing emails against high-value targets. The email messages contained malicious attachments that require that macros be enabled. The malicious macros used two Office exploits, CVE-2014-6352 and CVE-2017-0199, to execute malicious code on the victim's system to download and install malware.<br><br>In September 2020, security researchers uncovered a campaign of the group that started with spear phishing emails with malicious attachments. Some of the emails dealt with the COVID-19 situation. The group used the Azure infrastructure for its command and control servers. The campaign targeted higher education and government organizations in Asia.<br><br>On July 19, 2021, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) published an announcement that four Chinese nationals (Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, Wu Shurong, and Zhu Yunmin) working with the Ministry of State Security (HSSD) were charged concerning a global computer intrusion campaign associated with the state-sponsored hacking group known as APT40 between 2011 and 2018. During that period APT40 was responsible for hacking into various companies, universities, and government entities in the U.S. and worldwide targeting intellectual property and confidential information to leverage the compromised data in the purpose of boosting economic growth, serving China‚Äôs agenda. The four established a so-called ‚Äùlegitimate‚Äù company named Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co. Ltd. (Hainan Xiandun) based in China, covering their illegal activities used in several operations.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In August 2022, Proofpoint researchers linked APT40 with moderate confidence to a cyberespionage campaign,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">ScanBox,</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;targeting Australian government and&nbsp;media organizations, and wind turbine fleets in the South China Sea. In the course of the campaign that took place between&nbsp;April to June 2022, the threat actors sent their victims phishing email messages from Gmail and Outlook accounts while impersonating employees of media outlets. The messages contained links to seemingly legitimate news websites that delivered&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">the ScanBox&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">reconnaissance</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;framework through&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">JavaScript execution and staged module loading. The ScanBox modules could be used to log user keystrokes, identify installed web browser plugins, implement&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">WebRTC to real-time communication over APIs, and detect installed antivirus software. Once deployed, the framework established command and control (C2) connection and exfiltrated victim data, including general system and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">web browser (e.g. version, language, and location). The ScanBox campaign was also linked to older APT40 campaigns that targeted users through RTF template injections to load&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Meterpreter onto their machines.</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div>Following the 2020 Malaysian campaign, security researchers published a relevant YARA rule:<br><br>rule APT_APT40_Implant_June2020 {<br>   meta:<br>       version = \"1.0\"<br>       author =  \"Elastic Security\"<br>       date_added = \"2020-06-19\"<br>       description = \"APT40 second stage implant\"<br>    strings:<br>        $a = \"/list_direction\" fullword wide<br>        $b = \"/post_document\" fullword wide<br>        $c = \"/postlogin\" fullword wide<br>        $d = \"Download Read Path Failed %s\" fullword ascii<br>        $e = \"Open Pipe Failed %s\" fullword ascii<br>        $f = \"Open Remote File %s Failed For: %s\" fullword ascii<br>        $g = \"Download Read Path Failed %s\" fullword ascii<br>        $h = \"\\\\cmd.exe\" fullword wide<br>    condition:<br>        all of them<br>}",

The programs, hosted on popular websites such as Softpedia and Uptodown, delay the execution of their malicious components for up to a month so as to evade detection. The program installer is downloaded by the user as an encrypted RAR archive which starts a seven-staged infection chain of repeated installation of droppers, along with the creation of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. The droppers employ various anti-analysis and anti-detection techniques that enable them to thwart sandboxes, detect antivirus software, bypass firewalls, and avoid running on virtual machines. At the seventh attack stage, an XMRig cryptojacking software is fetched from a remote command and control (C2) server and exploits the system resources to mine cryptocurrency. The cryptominer sends the C2 a full system report through HTTP POST requests, in order for it to determine its functionality (e.g. the amount of CPU power to use and when to abort).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",

The group distributed their own malware, together with malware for other criminal groups, along with custom spam messaging.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "The group started spreading ransomware in 2016 with the Locky ransomware that targeted home consumers. The group stopped using the Locky ransomware when they shifted their targets from home consumers to enterprise targets. For that purpose, they created a custom ransomware named BitPaymer.<br><br>Evil Corp used their vast botnet of computers infected with the Dridex malware to look for corporate networks and then deploy BitPaymer on the largest enterprise targets they could identify. They operated BitPaymer between 2017 and 2019.<br><br>In December 2019, the US Department of Justice charged Russian citizens Maksim V. Yakubets and Igor Turashev for deploying the Dridex malware and for their involvement in international bank fraud and computer hacking schemes. After that indictment, the hacking group began restructuring its tactics. <br><br>In June 2020, Fox-It published an article about ‚ÄúWastedLocker,‚Äù a new ransomware variant developed by EvilCorp. The name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an abbreviation of the victim‚Äôs name and the string ‚Äòwasted‚Äô.<br><br>In June 2020, the EvilCorp gang hacked into dozens of US newspaper websites owned by the same company in order to infect the employees of over 30 major US private firms.<br>The attackers were using fake software update alerts displayed by the malicious SocGholish JavaScript-based framework.<br><br>On July 27th, 2020, Garmin, the wearables and GPS tracker maker, announced that they suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted some of their systems. This attack, which took place four days prior to the announcement, was linked to EvilCorp. Garmin paid 10 million USD to release their systems.<br><br>In October 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued an advisory alerting companies that engage with victims of ransomware attacks of the potential sanction risks for facilitating ransomware payments.<br><br>As part of this restructure, Evil Corp began distributing the WastedLocker ransomware in targeted attacks against businesses.<br><br>In October 2021, the group started to use another ransomware, dubbed \"Macaw Locker.\" It was used in two recorded attacks that month against the Japanese technology company, Olympus, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. The threat actor demanded a total of 68 million dollars ransom in the attacks.<br><br>In June 2022, Mandiant researchers reported that the UNC2165 group overlapping with Evil Corp started deploying the LockBit ransomware strain. This enabled Evil Corp to blend in with other LockBit affiliates and evade sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In addition, it was assumed that the group moved to a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model in order to free resources that were invested in ransomware development, such as Hades.<div><br></div><div>In August 2022, eSentire researchers linked a member of&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">UNC2165,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">mx1r, to an attack against the security vendor Cisco in May 2022 and an unnamed workforce management solutions company a month earlier.

The HTA file runs a PowerShell script that deploys three modules: the ModernLoader payload, a module that injects it into a newly created process (e.g. RegSvcs.exe), and another that disables the Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). Once executed, ModernLoader can gather system information (e.g. IP address, OS version, and installed anti-malware software), execute arbitrary commands, and download additional malware from the command and control (C2) server, including the XMRig cryptominer and various infostealers. In some observed campaigns, ModernLoader acted as the main bot that communicated with the C2 server while maintaining remote access to the victim‚Äôs machine and enabling the download of malware like RedLine Stealer, SystemBC, and DCRat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",

The infostealer is sold on cybercrime forums and marketplaces for time-limited subscriptions ranging between $100 and $700, or $900 for a lifetime license.<br/><br/>When deployed, Prynt Stealer creates folders for harvested data and steals documents, database files, source codes, and image files. Then, it collects sensitive web browser information, such as credit card information, autofill data, user credentials, cookies, and search history, account tokens for messaging apps (e.g. Telegram and Discord), gaming apps‚Äô files (e.g. Steam and Minecraft), and cryptocurrency information. Before the exfiltration, Prynt Stealer collects general system information about running processes, takes screenshots of the victim‚Äôs system, extracts the network credentials, and steals the Windows product key. Once the data collection process is completed, all the stolen information is exfiltrated to a remote command and control (C2) server through a Telegram bot.    <br/><br/>Unlike common infostealers, Prynt Stealer also has a keylogger for recording user keystrokes and a clipper for monitoring cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Once a crypto transaction attempt is detected, the malware operators replace the recipient's address with the threat actor‚Äôs controlled accounts. In addition, Prynt Stealer features various anti-detection mechanisms. Its embedded binary contains hardcoded strings that are encrypted, as well as its C2 communications.",

Then, the threat actors scan the compromised network to obtain weak access points and valid credentials for lateral movement. DarkAngels access NAS instances and other enterprise assets using weak and common passwords and exfiltrate sensitive data before encrypting the system. The threat actors were observed lingering in the system for five months before initiating the encryption.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once executed, the DarkAngels ransomware strain, sometimes packed in an ELF format, calls an API that ensures the malware‚Äôs activities terminate only before the system shutdown. Another API makes a connection to the service control manager and gives the ransomware access to the service control manager database. Then, it enumerates the services that run on the victim‚Äôs machine (e.g. VSS, SQL, and Memtas) and terminates the ones that might interfere with the encryption process. To prevent system recovery, the DarkAngels ransomware deletes volume shadow copies and all items from the Recycle Bin. The encrypted files are appended with the .crypt or .crypted extension. Some files, such as EXE, DLL, and BABYK, are excluded from encryption. Finally, a ransom note (How_To_Restore_Your_Files.txt) with negotiation instructions is dropped in the encrypted folders.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DarkAngels used to operate a Tor leak site, which currently seems offline. The group registers some of their associated domains using a privacy domain registration proxy service, probably to maintain anonymity.

The globally distributed botnet compromises technological devices, such as IoT devices, cameras, routers, ‚Äã‚Äãand DVRs, in countries such as the United States, South Korea, Japan, and India. Moobot is based on the notorious Mirai botnet, and is also similar to the Satori botnet. <br/><br/>Moobot spreads by leveraging weak telnet passwords and remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, some of which are zero-day, in order to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The Moobot operators use port scanning to detect vulnerable devices and once found, they infect them with the botnet, and establish a command and control (C2) communication to take remote control and execute additional commands. Then, the C2 server creates a network overflow, by executing various flood commands, such as UDP, SYN, ACK, or ACK+PUSH.<br/><br/>The vulnerabilities that were observed to be exploited by Moobot include: zero-day vulnerability in the LILIN DVR‚Äôs NTPUpdate process, Tenda remote code execution (CVE-2020-10987), Huawei Router arbitrary command execution (CVE-2017-17215), and a command injection vulnerability in Hikvision cameras (CVE-2021-36260).",

            "Overview": "TA505, active since at least 2014, is a financially motivated threat group, likely of Russian origin, that is known for frequently changing malware and driving global trends in criminal malware distribution. The APT group targets multiple financial institutions and retail companies using malicious spam campaigns and different malware. In 2019, the group expanded its criminal operation to other industries. <br/><br/>TA505 is highly adaptable, frequently shifting techniques and malware to ‚Äúfollow the money,‚Äù while largely sticking to successful strategies where possible. This group is responsible for large malicious spam campaigns, mostly distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan, Locky ransomware, and the TrickBot banking Trojan. The group also used several other malware in very high volume attacks.<br/><br/>Exclusive malware to TA505 include:  Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "On July 28, 2014, TA505 launched its first known attack using Dridex banking Trojan. These early campaigns were distributed via the Lerspeng downloader. Later campaigns occasionally used Pony or Andromeda as intermediate loaders to distribute various instances of Dridex. TA505 continued distributing Dridex via email attachments through early June 2017.<br><br>In October 2015, TA505 launched several campaigns that targeted Japanese and UK organizations using the Shifu banking Trojan, delivered through macro-laden Office document attachments. A few days after those attacks, TA505 returned to distribute Dridex in high volume.<br><br>In February 2016, TA505 introduced Locky ransomware. TA505 stopped distributing Dridex in July 2016, relying almost exclusively on Locky through December of that year.<br><br>In April 2016, TA505 first introduced Rockloader as an intermediate loader for Locky. At that time, Rockloader was the initial payload downloaded by malicious attached JavaScript files. Once Rockloader was installed, it downloaded Locky and, in some cases, Pony and Kegotip.<br>Pony is a loader with information-stealing capabilities while Kegotip is a credential and email address harvesting malware strain that appeared in a small number of TA505 campaigns on 2017 as the primary payload.<br><br>On June 24, 2016, Bart ransomware appeared for exactly one day. It was a secondary payload downloaded by Rockloader.<br><br>In mid-2016, TA505 used the Necurs botnet to drive their high-volume spam campaigns. TA505 was heavily reliant on this massive botnet to send out high-volume malicious spam campaigns. The disappearances of TA505 activity frequently accompany disruptions in Necurs.<br><br>In April 2017, TA505 briefly distributed the Kegotip information stealer. It was used to steal credentials from various FTP clients, Outlook, and Internet Explorer. It also gathered email addresses scraped from files stored on the computer.<br><br>In May 2017, TA505 started using Jaff ransomware. Jaff was not dramatically different from other ransomware strains that the group used.<br><br>in June 2017, TA505 first began distributing Trickbot banking Trojan in frequent, high-volume campaigns. The last TA505 campaigns featuring Trickbot appeared in mid-September 2017 with payloads alternating between Locky and Trickbot.<br><br>Philadelphia ransomware has been circulating since September 2016 in use in highly targeted campaigns. TA505 distributed it in one large campaign in July 2017.<br><br>At the end of July 2017, TA505 began including GlobeImposter in malicious spam campaigns. TA505 primarily distributed GlobeImposter in zipped script attachments through the beginning of September 2017.<br><br>In August 2017, TA505 started spreading Locky through phishing URLs. Most of these URLs were linked to malicious documents and scripts. The group had gone back to large attachment campaigns, primarily distributing various zipped scripts that downloaded Locky.<br><br>In November 2018, TA505 began distributing ServHelper backdoor. ServHelper has two variants: one acting as a remote desktop agent and one as a downloader for a RAT called FlawedGrace.<br><br>Since December 2018, TA505 has been using legitimate or compromised RATs (remote access Trojans) such as FlawedAmmyy, FlawedGrace, and Remote Manipulator System (RMS).<br><br>In April 2019, TA505 targeted Chile, Mexico, and Italy using either FlawedAmmyy RAT or RMS RAT as payload. By the end of April 2019, the group started going after targets in East Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan, using FlawedAmmyy.<br><br>In June 2019, TA505 launched two spam campaigns distributing the downloader FlawedAmmyy (also called AndroMut), targeting the U.S, Singapore, UAE, and South Korea.<br><br>In July 2019, the group also started several malicious spam campaigns that distributed malware new strains. They used Gelup downloader and the FlowerPippi backdoor to attack targets from the Middle East, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Argentina.<br>Gelup downloader abuses user account control (UAC) bypass and works as a loader for other threats. The tool also uses the packer of FlawedAmmyy.<br><br>In October 2019, Security researchers observed that TA505 has been using a new RAT dubbed SDbot.<br><br>In January 2020, Microsoft published a report regarding an ongoing phishing campaign attributed to TA505. This phishing campaign was using attachments featuring HTML redirectors for delivering malicious Excel documents.<br><br>In February 2020, Fox-IT published a report in which they connected TA505 to a ransomware attack on a university in the Netherlands. Maastricht University (UM) disclosed that it paid a 30 bitcoin ransom requested by the attackers who encrypted some of its critical systems following a cyberattack that took place on December 23, 2019.<br><br>In March 2020, a new TA505 campaign was discovered. In this campaign, the group has targeted businesses in Germany via their human resources executives and Google drive.<br><br>In October 2020, Microsoft observed new threat activity exploiting the critical Zerologon vulnerability CVE-2020-1472. The campaign poses as software updates that lead to a UAC bypass and the use of wscript.exe to run malicious scripts connected with known TA505 command and control (C2) infrastructure.<br><br>On November 13, 2020, the Australian government issued a security alert urging local health sector organizations to check their cybersecurity defenses, and especially their controls for detecting and stopping ransomware attacks. They had observed increased targeting activity against the Australian Health sector by actors using the SDBBot remote access tool. Additionally, the ACSC says that SDBBot is also a known precursor of the Clop ransomware. While the ACSC did not provide any details about threat actors, the SDBBot RAT has been almost exclusively distributed by TA505, thus also tying them to the Clop ransomware.<br><br>In December 2020, security researchers discovered a new malware dubbed Clop ransomware. Clop ransomware is a variant of the Cryptomix ransomware, which was seen in use by TA505. <br><br>In October 2021, TA505 was linked to a phishing campaign dubbed MirrorBlast targeting organizations from multiple sectors in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, Europe, and more. The threat actors sent their victims macro-embedded Excel documents deploying two malicious variants of the MSI package, REBOL and KiXtart. The malicious payloads were used to collect general system information, such as username and OS version, and exfiltrated this information to a remote server.<br><br>In July 2022, Maastricht University revealed that it managed to recover a ransom payment, which was made to TA505 after the group hit its systems in December 2019. At that time, TA505 breached the university's network and deployed the Clop ransomware on 267 Windows systems, encrypting the files that were stored on them. The group demanded a 30 Bitcoin ransom (roughly ‚Ç¨200,000 at the time), which was paid by the university. However, a few months later, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service seized a cryptocurrency wallet belonging to TA505, helping Maastricht University recover the paid ransom.<br><br>In September 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported that TA505 have started using a new control panel, TeslaGun, to manage the ServHelper backdoor. The threat actors were observed using the control panel as a C2 framework to issue commands across the compromised victim devices for operating ServHelper. The majority of the group's infrastructure was found to be located in Moldova.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>MITRE ATT&amp;CK¬Æ TTPs:<br><br>T1087\tAccount Discovery: Email Account.<br>T1071\tApplication Layer Protocol: Web Protocols.<br>T1059\tCommand and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell, Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic, Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript/JScript, Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell.<br>T1555\tCredentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers.<br>T1486\tData Encrypted for Impact.<br>T1568\tDynamic Resolution: Fast Flux DNS.<br>T1105\tIngress Tool Transfer.<br>T1559\tInter-Process Communication: Dynamic Data Exchange.<br>T1027\tObfuscated Files or Information, Software Packing.<br>T1069\tPermission Groups Discovery.<br>T1566\tPhishing: Spearphishing Attachment, Phishing: Spearphishing Link.<br>T1055\tProcess Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection.<br>T1218\tSigned Binary Proxy Execution: Msiexec, Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32.<br>T1553\tSubvert Trust Controls: Code Signing.<br>T1552\tUnsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files.<br>T1204\tUser Execution: Malicious File◊™ User Execution: Malicious Link.<br>T1078\tValid Accounts: Domain Accounts.",

            "Overview": "<div>The Shikitega malware was first reported by cybersecurity researchers in September 2022. The malware targets Linux endpoints and IoT devices.</div><div><br></div><div>Shikitega is deployed using the polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder ‚ÄúShikata Ga Nai.‚Äù It has a multistage infection chain where each module (starting from a small ELF file) delivers only a few hundred bytes of the payload and then downloads and executes the next one. Once the final shellcode is decrypted and executed, it communicates with the malware's command and control (C2) servers that are hosted on legitimate cloud hosting services, then it receives additional commands and executes files directly from memory. One of these commands executes ‚ÄúMettle,‚Äù a Metasploit Meterpreter payload that provides the attacker with further remote administration capabilities including webcam access and process control. It also enables the malware operators to run reverse shells and execute additional commands to retrieve a next-stage dropper. The dropper exploits known Linux vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-4034 and CVE-2021-3493) to gain elevated privileges and uses them to download and execute the final stage payload, the XMRig cryptominer. To achieve persistence, the malware executes five shell scripts and adds four root crontabs. As the crontabs are placed, Shikitega attempts to hide by deleting all the downloaded files from the system.</div>",

To increase credibility, the French-language messages often impersonate African financial institutions, such as the Tunisian Foreign bank and Nedbank. The malicious attachments download different file types (e.g. LNK, VBE, and JAR) that lead to the deployment of both custom or open-source malware and tools, such as Metasploit, PoshC2, DWservice, and AsyncRAT, usually triggered by using PowerShell scripts. To evade detection, the threat actors run Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypass commands, and inject their malicious binaries into legitimate Microsoft processes. System persistence is established by dropping batch files and creating scheduled tasks.

            "Overview": "The LockerGoga ransomware first appeared in the second half of January 2019. It compromised aluminum and renewable energy company Norsk Hydro in March 2019 and allegedly, Altran Technologies in January 2019. Its origin might be Romanian or Polish, as the first identified sample was uploaded to Virus Total on the 24th of January 2019 from Romanian IP and each ransom note included polish contacts. LockerGoga has no fixed price for decryption. Instead, it requests the user to contact the threat actor by email for a price quote.<br><br>LockerGoga encrypts data very fast as it spawns hundreds of processes for encryption and ends up using every CPU core and thread (this could also be used to monitor ransomware activity). It implements symmetric Rijndael cipher more commonly known as AES, although in its ransom note it states that a mix of RSA-4096 and AES-256 is used. Encrypted files receive .locked extension. The ransom note that drops after the encryption is named README-NOW.txt. Malicious samples were signed by a legitimate certificate of MIKL Limited, issued by Comodo.  The certificate has since been revoked. The ransomware does not have a lateral movement module and has to be deployed by an attacker who already has admin access.<br><br><div>In the case of Norsk Hydro, propagation of LockerGoga to endpoints occurred by using the company's own Active Directory against them. The hackers obtained admin credentials and then used windows built-in techniques to propagate. The malware allegedly propagated by creating scheduled tasks or services thus making each endpoint download and run the malware.<br></div>",

Implement Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution to prevent Mimikatz and Pass The Hash attacks.

The advanced variant of TeamTNT‚Äôs worm also scans and steals local credentials from misconfigured Docker systems, looking for open directories, using open ports (such as 2375, 2376, 2377, 4243, or 4244), as well as deploys publicly known offensive security tools, such as SSH post-exploitation tools, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) backdoor, and the Diamorphine rootkit. Security researchers assume that this is the first cryptomining worm with AWS stealing functionalities.<br><br>In October 2020, Palo Alto Network‚Äôs researchers discovered that the group is using additional capabilities to the group's TTP. TeamTNT was observed using a new cryptomining variant dubbed  Black-T. Black-T contains network scanning capabilities for identifying victims' exposed Docker APIs.<br><br>In December 2020, TeamTNT was observed to use a new IRC bot called TNTbotinger that can initiate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  <br><br>In January 2021, Trend Micro researchers reported that TeamTNT updated its malware code to make it more organized and descriptive. The threat actors also added a new feature that enables them to collect Docker API credentials, in addition to AWS credentials.<br><br>In the same month, AT&amp;T Alien Labs reported that TeamTNT added more tools to its attack arsenal, the Golang-based Ezuri  memory loader, and an open-source tool named libprocesshider. The latter was used to hide malicious processes by employing the preloading technique. <br><br>In February 2021, TeamTNT was observed using a new malware, dubbed Hildegard, to initiate a cryptojacking campaign targeting Kubernetes clusters. The Hildegard malware enabled the threat actors to gain initial system access, by abusing kubelet‚Äôs API to execute commands inside containers. The new malware featured different obfuscation mechanisms, such as mimicking a known Linux process (bioset) to disguise its activities, using the preloading technique to hide malicious processes, and encrypting its malicious payload inside a binary to make automated static analysis more difficult. In addition, it could use two ways to establish C2 connection, via a tmate reverse shell and an IRC channel. Once infiltrating the system, the threat actors downloaded tmate, a software application that provides a secure terminal sharing solution over an SSH connection, and established a reverse shell to tmate.io. Then, they used masscan to find other unsecured kubelet and deployed a cryptomining script (xmr.sh) to containers managed by these kubelets.   <br><br>In October 2021, Uptycs researchers reported that TeamTNT was observed to deploy a malicious container image, hosted on Docker Hub under the alias \"alpineos.\" The malicious Docker image had an embedded shell script that was used to download the ZGrab and masscanner scanning tools and find suitable targets. Once found, the threat actors deployed various malware, such as XMRig, the Tsunami IRC bo, and the Diamorphine rootkit. <br><br>In November 2021, Trend Micro researchers reported on a new TeamTNT campaign targeting vulnerable Docker servers to install Monero cryptominers. The group used over 150,000 pulls of images from its controlled Docker Hub accounts, to be deployed on the target host. <br><br>In April 2022, Cisco Talos researchers reported that TeamTNT modified its scripts to target exposed Docker API instances on Amazon Web Services. The threat actors also attempted to disable cloud security mechanisms, such as Alibaba's aegis cloud security agent, to evade detection and maintain persistence, enabling them to mine cryptocurrency for an extended amount of time.<div><br></div><div>On September 12, 2022, Trend Micro researchers discovered&nbsp;credentials for at least two DockerHub accounts used by TeamTNT. One of the accounts (<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">alpineos) hosted a&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">malicious container image, downloaded more than 150,000 times, that contained&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">rootkits, kits for Docker container escape, the XMRig Monero miner, the Kinsing malware, credential stealers, and Kubernetes exploit kits. The threat actors were found to log into their&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">DockerHub registry from IP addresses from Germany. Their goal was to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">exploit the Docker REST API and compromise the underlying server, in order to perform cryptojacking.</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">On September 15, 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported three different attack vectors that have been used by TeamTNT in recent campaigns. The first type of attack, named&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">‚ÄúThe Kangaroo Attack‚Äù</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;after the use of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Pollard‚Äôs Kangaroo WIF solver, includes the exploitation of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">vulnerable Docker Daemons</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;to deploy&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">an AlpineOS image and a shell script (</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">k.sh) that fetches the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Bitcoin encryption solvers</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">from GitHub. In the second type of attack, \"</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Cronb Attack,\" the threat actors deploy shell files that lead to the execution of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">cron jobs to gain persistence,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">cryptominers to hijack resources, and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">rootkits to hide their activity. In addition, this attack includes the theft of SSH keys to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">conduct lateral movement in the victim's network. The third attack vector, \"</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">What Will Be,\" is similar to the second one, only it includes the exploitation of vulnerable&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Docker Daemons to deploy&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Alpine images, before the download and execution of shell scripts,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">rootkits, a cryptominer, cronjobs, and SSH scanners. In this type of attack, the threat actors added a new trick of optimizing the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">cryptomining performance by modifying the CPU's specific registers based on the system architecture.</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>MITRE ATT&amp;CK¬Æ TTPs:<br><br>T1098.004 - Account Manipulation: SSH Authorized Keys<br>T1583.001 - Acquire Infrastructure: Domains<br>T1595.001 - Active Scanning: Scanning IP Blocks<br>T1595.002 - Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning<br>T1071 - Application Layer Protocol<br>T1071.001 - Web Protocols<br>T1547.001 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder<br>T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell<br>T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell<br>T1059.004 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell<br>T1609 - Container Administration Command<br>T1613 - Container and Resource Discovery<br>T1136.001 - Create Account: Local Account<br>T1543.002 - Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service<br>T1543.003 - Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service<br>T1610 - Deploy Container<br>T1587.001 - Develop Capabilities: Malware<br>T1611 - Escape to Host<br>T1133 - External Remote Services<br>T1222.002 - File and Directory Permissions Modification: Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification<br>T1562.001 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools<br>T1562.004 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall<br>T1070.002 - Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Linux or Mac System Logs<br>T1070.003 - Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Command History<br>T1070.004 - Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion<br>T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer<br>T1046 - Network Service Scanning<br>T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information<br>T1027.002 - Software Packing<br>T1057 - Process Discovery<br>T1219 - Remote Access Software<br>T1021.004 - Remote Services: SSH<br>T1496 - Resource Hijacking<br>T1014 - Rootkit<br>T1518.001 - Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery<br>T1608.001 - Stage Capabilities: Upload Malware<br>T1082 - System Information Discovery<br>T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery<br>T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery<br>T1552.001 - Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files<br>T1552.004 - Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys<br>T1552.005 - Unsecured Credentials: Cloud Instance Metadata API<br>T1204.003 - User Execution: Malicious Image<br>T1102 - Web Service</div>",

The Anonymous-affiliated group gained prominence with the #OpIsis and #OpParis‚Äã‚Äã (following the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015) campaigns, in which various hacktivist groups took down thousands of ISIS websites and social media accounts using defacement and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Since then, GhostSec participated in other campaigns, such as #OpLebanon, #OpNigeria, #OpMyanmar, #OpEcuador, and #OpColombia. Other than these campaigns, the group has consistently targeted Israeli entities with ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù messages. In addition, GhostSec goes strongly against pedophiles, repeatedly doxxing child molesters and exposing their identities.</div><div><br></div><div>GhostSec was co-founded by an online entity called Sebastian Delax or Sebastian Dante Alexander along with another entity that uses the moniker Ghost3301 (stylized as&nbsp;</div><div>∆çHÔºØ·èïT3»úŒüŒô).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In February 2022, amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War, GhostSec announced its support in Ukraine and took down Russian military and government websites using DDoS attacks. In addition, over the course of the war, the group claimed to access the IT systems of critical infrastructure organizations in Russia, such as Metrospetstekhnika, a provider of Russia‚Äôs metro.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In June 2022, GhostSec joined the #OpIsrael campaign that targeted multiple Israeli companies while gaining access to their IoT interfaces and ICS/SCADA systems. The group claimed to breach the interfaces of various Israeli organizations, such as the Partner.co.il interface and ELNet, an energy and electrical power meter at MATAM (the Scientific Industries Center). Some of the attacks were made using the Metasploit framework module.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In September 2022, it was reported that GhostSec compromised 55 Berghof programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used by Israeli organizations. The breach was assumed to be conducted by guessing commonly used login credentials. The group published screenshots from the compromised admin panels and leaked data that was stolen in the attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The GhostSec members maintain several GitHub accounts that contain commonly used tools. The main repository used by the group, ghostsec420, includes seven repositories, some of which include leaked data (e.g. NigeriaLeaks), vulnerability scanners, and exploits. In addition, the Sophisticated Cyber Penetration Attacks (SCPA) repository contains advanced attack tools and guides from various sources, such as the leaked Conti playbook.</div><div><br></div><div>GhostSec also maintains a Pastebin user account, xGhostSecx, that includes anti-Israeli logs from an online reconnaissance tool. The paste contains a target list of several companies‚Äô domains and their corresponding IP addresses. These can later be used to execute malicious activity against them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "<div>As part of its battle against ISIS, GhostSec tipped law enforcement authorities about planned terrorist attacks in New York and Tunisia. This cooperation led the group to ‚Äúbecome legit‚Äù; it renamed itself \"Ghost Security Group\" (or GSG) and ended its association with Anonymous. Group members who opposed this transition continued their association with Anonymous under the old \"GhostSec\" umbrella. The ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù entity operates a clear web website with information about the group‚Äôs activities, while the GhostSec faction operates an active Telegram channel with news about ongoing attacks and data leaks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One of the outspoken members of the Ghost Security Group is the Jordanian activist and former beauty queen, Lara Abdallat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 10, 2022, GhostSec allegedly compromised an Israeli hotel pool system and took control of the&nbsp;pool's pH and chlorine levels. The threat actors seemed to breach&nbsp;two Aegis II controllers exposed to the internet using default passwords. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",

The malware was offered for sale on several Russian underground forums, with its price varying depending on the version (standalone/subscription) and other customization services sold by the threat actor.<br><br>RedLine Stealer, written in C#, is constantly evolving improving its capabilities and efficiency. Its main purpose is to harvest information from the victims‚Äô infected machines such as saved login credentials, credit card numbers, FTP servers, web browser data, instant messaging clients, and cryptocurrency wallet numbers. The malware can bypass security products, steal downloading files, execute commands, and send all the collected data to a remote C&amp;C server that can be managed via a simple GUI command and control (C2) panel.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "Since its appearance, RedLine Stealer has been used by threat actors on several campaigns with alternating themes, subjects, or specific audiences.<br><br>On February 09, 2021, a security research team reported that threat actors tried to exploit the increasing activity of online gaming users following the COVID-19 outbreak, to spread malicious files with RedLine Stealer on Discord, an instant messaging application commonly used by the gaming community. <br><br>In May 2021, researchers identified threat actors who were utilizing pay-per-click (PPC) ads on Google‚Äôs search results to disguise a few malicious packages wrapped as ISO installers of popular apps such as Telegram, AnyDesk, and others.<br><br>In June 2021, RedLine operators targeted digital artists using digital tokens tied to digital assets called NFT (Non-Fungible Token). The victims reported being approached by the threat actors on different social media platforms or even directly via email to create new digital art and publish their work for sale on NFT marketplaces. <br><br>In December 2021, it was reported that undisclosed threat actors initiated a malspam campaign to distribute malicious Excel XLL files, executing the RedLine Stealer. The malware was used to steal sensitive data, such as user credentials and credit card information, from various types of web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox). At the end of that month, the \"Have I Been Pwned\" data breach notification service added approximately 450,000 email addresses stolen by RedLine between August and September 2021. In case your email is listed, it is recommended to change all passwords used on the computer, including corporate VPN and email accounts and personal accounts, and to scan the system using antivirus software. <br><br>In the same month, cybersecurity researchers reported that RedLine has a built-in automatic login feature on web browsers. This feature enables it to harvest user credentials from the \"Login Data\" file found on all Chromium-based web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge). Even when users refuse to store the credentials on the browser, an entry for the user's account is still added to the \"Login Data\" file and is classified as \"blacklisted\". Although threat actors do not have access to the credentials found on \"blacklisted\" account entries, they still know that such accounts exist and might perform some credential-stealing attack via phishing or social engineering.<br><br>In January 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new RedLine campaign targeting 12 unnamed countries. The malware operators distributed a COVID-19 Omicron file called ‚ÄúOmicron Stats.exe,‚Äù presumably via phishing email messages. Once the file was executed, a new variant of RedLine was deployed onto the victims' networks. The new variant added more data points to exfiltrate, such as the graphics card name, BIOS data, disk drive characteristics, and CPU information. In addition, it can exfiltrate Telegram and Discord data. The new variant also targets additional apps, such as Opera GX web browser, OpenVPN, and ProtonVPN.<br><br>In February 2022, it was reported that threat actors started to spread fake Windows 11 upgrade installers to Windows 10 users, tricking them into downloading and executing RedLine stealer. The threat actors used a seemingly legitimate domain to add credibility to their scheme and exhort the victims to download ZIP files with executables that deployed the malware.<br><br>In March 2022, ASEC researchers reported on a campaign disguising RedLine as game hacks for Valorant. The threat actors posted links on YouTube, leading to the download of RAR archives with RedLine executables. Once installed, the malware was used to collect general system information, user credentials, web browser data, cryptocurrency information, and more. The stolen information was then packed in a ZIP file and exfiltrated via a WebHook API POST request to a Discord server.<br><br>In April 2022, Bitdefender researchers reported on a new RedLine campaign, in which threat actors used the RIG Exploit Kit to distribute their malware. The attackers exploited an Internet Explorer memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2021-26411) to compromise systems and infect them with the RedLine Stealer in a packed form. It was then unpacked in a six-stage process before being deployed as an obfuscated .NET executable. Once deployed, RedLine established a C2 connection and then could be used to steal and exfiltrate passwords, web browser cookies and stored credit card data, chat logs, VPN login credentials, cryptocurrency information, and more.<br><br>In May 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported on a new campaign, in which threat actors promoted fake Binance NFT mystery box bots on YouTube to distribute RedLine. The YouTube videos exhorted the victims to download the fake bots, hosted on GitHub, dropping a malicious ZIP file and a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installer. In addition, the ZIP file contained a TXT file with instructions on how to run the installer and in fact execute the RedLine infostealer. The malware was designed to terminate its operation if the host computer is located in one of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), e.g. Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.<div><br></div><div>In August 2022,&nbsp;RedLine was observed to be deployed through YouTube videos allegedly guiding users&nbsp;to get paid subscriptions for free, but in fact, tricking them into&nbsp;installing the malicious software. The links to these software were often embedded in the video description.</div><div><br></div><div>Also in the same month,&nbsp;Zscaler researchers reported multiple ongoing campaigns, in which threat actors have used SEO poisoning methods to promote malicious pirated software (e.g.&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat Pro) that led to the deployment of RedLine (sometimes RecordBreaker stealer). The malicious executables were hosted on known file hosting services, such as Mediafire, and were downloaded as password-protected ZIP archives to evade antivirus detection. Once unpacked, using an attached text file with the password, the malware loader was executed as an encoded PowerShell command that launched a Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) after a 10 seconds timeout to evade sandbox analysis. Then, the loader connected to a C2 server and executed a DLL file that contained the&nbsp;RedLine Stealer payload.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 6, 2022, Avast researchers reported on the&nbsp;Redline Stealer being distributed through compromised&nbsp;Facebook business pages. The compromised accounts from different countries (Brazil, Mexico, Slovakia, and the&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Philippines) promoted Trojanized apps, such as&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Adobe Acrobat Reader, that contained the malware.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">On September 15, 2022, RedLine was reported to be distributed through links to Youtube videos that advertised cheats and cracks to known video games, such as&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">CrossFire,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">FIFA 22, and Final Fantasy XIV. The links led to the download of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">self-extracting RAR archives that contained the malware executables.</span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">On September 20, 2022, it was disclosed that the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">American video game publisher 2K was hacked and its customers were infected with RedLine Stealer. The malware operators gained credentials of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">one of&nbsp;</span>2K<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">'s vendors and used them to compromise the company's&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">help desk platform and send&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">fake support email messages. Once the recipients opened the support tickets, they received another message that exhorted them to download a ZIP archive with the malware executable.&nbsp;</span></div>",

Although it is not directly associated with any governmental entity, its primary targets, minority rights activists in China (e.g. Uyghur and Tibetan), are compatible with the interests of the Chinese government. The group was also observed operating against government organizations in Russia and India, nations that track activists and terrorists.<br><br>Scarlet Mimic usually distributes its malware on PC and mobile devices through watering hole attacks or spear phishing email messages that contain decoy documents exploiting various software vulnerabilities (e.g. Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader). Some of the decoy documents are created using different toolkits, such as MNKit, WingD, and Tran Duy Linh. In addition, in some cases, the phishing email messages contain self-extracting RAR archives that use the right-to-left override character to mask the real file extension. <br><br>After gaining initial access, the group deploys the FakeM custom backdoor that has evolved over time to include functionalities such as logging user keystrokes, stealing user credentials, taking screenshots, and uploading files, all while maintaining a connection to a command and control (C2) server. The original FakeM backdoor masks its C2 communication by mimicking legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers; however, more advanced variants use SSL for encrypting C2 communication. The backdoor is deployed using nine different malware loaders, such as CrypticConvo, SkiBoot, and RaidBase.<br><br>Cybersecurity researchers observed some overlaps of the IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and the APT2 threat group (AKA Putter Panda); however, no solid link could be established between the groups.<div><br></div><div>Other malware that have been used by Scarlet Mimic include: FakeHighFive, PiggyBack, FullThrottle, FakeFish, BrutishCommand, SubtractThis, CallMe, MobileOrder, and Psylo.<br></div>",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In September 2022, Check Point researchers reported a long-running Scarlet Mimic campaign against the Uyghur community that has been active since at least 2015. In the course of the campaign, the threat actors have used&nbsp;20 different variants of the MobileOrder&nbsp;Android malware and distributed it through seemingly legitimate applications often masqueraded as&nbsp;PDF documents of books, photos, or audio files of the Quran. The malware could be used to collect device information, access and manipulate SMS, steal call logs and local files, record audio, and take screenshots. In addition, some of the malware versions asked for&nbsp;Device Admin and root access that granted the threat actors full control over the device.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",

The Russian hacker-for-hire group targets organizations and individuals across the globe, from various sectors, such as government, telecommunications, retail, finance, media, and biotechnology. Most of the targets are located in Russia and surrounding countries.<br><br>Void Balaur sells access to webmail email accounts (e.g. Gmail, Protonmail, and Yandex), corporate email accounts, and social networks (e.g. Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram). The group‚Äôs services also include launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and distributing phone spam messages (only in the Commonwealth of Independent States). The threat actors publish their services on dedicated websites and on Russian hacking forums, such as Darkmoney, Probiv, Tenec, and Dublikat. <br><br>In 2019, the group started to sell stolen data of individuals, including passport information, traffic camera snapshots, weapon registration, criminal records, credit history, and bank statements. In addition, Void Balaur sells data from cellular services, such as phone numbers, phone and SMS logs, phone or SIM card location, and text messages. This data is assumed to be acquired through insiders working at telecom companies. In addition, Void Balaur was observed using phishing domains to obtain user credentials, especially for cryptocurrency wallets of various exchange services (e.g. Binance, EXMO, BitPay, and YoBit). The group uses different types of infostealers and spyware for Windows and Android, such as Z*Stealer and DroidWatcher, which are deployed using a Delphi-based loader.  <br><br>Void Balaur‚Äôs activity was connected to various incidents: an attack against human rights activists and journalists in Uzbekistan in 2016, against political entities in Belarus in 2020, and against government ministers in 2021. Also, in a long-running campaign that took place between September 2020 and August 2021, Void Balaur targeted high-level executives in a large Russian corporation.  <br><br>Cybersecurity researchers found some overlap between Void Balaur and the Russian state-sponsored group APT28 (AKA Fancy Bear), in terms of victimology and obtained data; however, there is no solid proof of a collaboration between the two groups.

            "Overview": "Fancy Bear (AKA APT 28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, and Strontium) is a state-sponsored hacking group associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The group has been active since 2007 and usually targets privileged information related to government, military, and security organizations. Among the Russian APT groups, Fancy Bear dominated in 2017, especially at the end of that year.<br/> <br/>Between February 10 and 14, 2015, during the ceasefire in Donbas (East Ukraine), APT 28 scanned 8,536,272 Ukrainian IP addresses for possible vulnerabilities. After February 14, 2015, APT28 shifted its attention to the west. They have also scanned for vulnerabilities in these countries: Spain, the UK, Portugal, the USA, and Mexico.<br/> <br/>According to the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, APT28 was responsible for the 2015 cyber attacks on Germany‚Äôs Parliament. The official also said: ‚ÄúThe UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Germany and our European partners to hold Russia to account for cyberattacks designed to undermine Western democracies. This criminal behavior brings the Russian Government into further disrepute.‚Äù<br/> <br/>In November 2017, it became known that Fancy Bear has actively exploited a newly discovered Microsoft Office vulnerability. Various widespread cyberattack campaigns were used to abuse it in the wild to infect several organizations with malware.<br/> <br/>Microsoft‚Äôs feature, Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), can be leveraged to perform code execution on the targeted device without requiring enabled macros or memory corruption. DDE protocol is one of several methods that Microsoft uses to allow two running applications to share the same data. The protocol is being used by many Microsoft apps.<br/> <br/>Fancy Bear hackers leveraged the DDE vulnerability in October 2016. The campaign involved documents referencing a recent terrorist attack in New York in an attempt to trick victims into clicking on the malicious documents, which eventually infects their systems with malware. Since DDE is a Microsoft legitimate feature, most antivirus solutions don't flag any warning or block the documents with DDE fields.<br/> <br/>In December 2017, it became known that Fancy Bear also targeted hundreds of journalists. At least 200 journalists have been targeted in a long-term attack that started as early as 2014. The list of victims included: 50 New York Times journalists, a Washington Post columnist, and a Daily Beast reporter. Along with American journalists, the attackers also tried to hack Ukrainian and Russian media personnel. According to the journalists, they have experienced spear-phishing attacks for years in an attempt to hack networks and access sources and information. In 2017, Fancy Bear also hacked Google accounts belonging to US military officials and various journalists.<br/> <br/>In previous years, the group had been connected to the Hillary Clinton emails leak and the hack of the Olympic games, among other campaigns and attacks.<br/> <br/>The most notable APT28 presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee, the German parliament, and the French television network TV5Monde.",
            "AdditionalInformation": "In August 2020, a joint report of the NSA and the FBI was released, in which they attributed a new malware to APT28 named Drovorub. Drovorub is a Linux malware consisting of an implant coupled with a kernel module rootkit, a file transfer, and port forwarding tool, and a command and control (C2) server. When deployed on a victim machine, the Drovorub implant (client) provides the capability for direct communications with the actor-controlled C2 infrastructure, file download and upload capabilities, execution of arbitrary commands as \"root,\" and port forwarding of network traffic to other hosts on the network.<br> <br>Also in the same month, the QuoIntelligence team disseminated a warning to its government customers in Europe about a new APT28 campaign. This campaign targets government bodies of NATO members (or countries cooperating with NATO). The researchers discovered a malicious file uploaded to VirusTotal, which ultimately drops a Zebrocy malware and communicates with a C2 in France.<br> <br>In September 2020, Microsoft researchers reported that state-sponsored Russian hacking group APT28 was observed targeting organizations and individuals involved in the US presidential election. According to the researchers, the group‚Äôs efforts are focused on stealing the targets' credentials and compromising their accounts to potentially disrupt the elections and to harvest intelligence to be used as part of future attacks.<br> <br>In addition, the U.S Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)<br>published that they responded to a recent threat actor cyberattack on a federal agency enterprise network. By leveraging compromised credentials, the threat actor implanted sophisticated malware including multi-stage malware that evaded the affected agency‚Äôs anti-malware protection and gained persistent access through two reverse Socket Secure (SOCKS) proxies that exploited weaknesses in the agency‚Äôs firewall.<br> <br>In October 2020, the UK announced it will enforce asset freezes and travel bans against two Russian GRU officers and APT28, aka Fancy Bear.<br> <br>On November 13, 2020, Microsoft said it detected three state-sponsored APTs that have launched cyberattacks on at least seven prominent companies involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and treatments. The targeted companies were located in Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the US. Microsoft traced the attacks to the Russian-based APT28, the North Korean-based group Lazarus, aka Zink, and the Cerium groups.<br> <br>On December 1, 2020, the Norwegian secret service published a press release saying that APT28 was most likely responsible for hacking the email accounts of the Norwegian Parliament in August 2020.<br> <br>On December 9, 2020, Intezer labs wrote that in November 2020, they uncovered COVID-19 phishing lures that were used to deliver the Go version of Zebrocy- a known APT28 malware. The lures consisted of documents about Sinopharm International Corporation (a pharmaceutical company that is currently going through phase three clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine) and an impersonated evacuation letter from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The lure was delivered as part of a virtual hard drive file that requires victims to use Windows 10 to access the files. APT28 has employed password spraying and brute-force login attempts to obtain login credentials, break into victim accounts and steal sensitive information.<br> <br>In May 2021, a security research team published a report regarding a new malware named ‚ÄúSkinnyBoy‚Äù attributed to APT28. The malware was used in spear phishing campaigns that started in early March, targeting government and military sectors and other political organizations. The victims received a spoofed invitation to an international scientific event held in Spain. While most of the victims were from the European Union, organizations in the United States were also impacted.<br> <br>In July 2021, a joint advisory by American and British agencies warned about an ongoing global brute force campaign conducted by APT28. According to the advisory, the group uses containers to easily scale its brute force attempts. Upon obtaining credentials, the group exploited several vulnerabilities, including CVE 2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144 for remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers. <br>The campaign was focused on US and European organizations from the following sectors: government, aerospace and defense, media, energy, legal, and education.<br><br>In October 2021, Google issued a warning that the group initiated a phishing campaign the previous month, targeting approximately 14 thousand Gmail users. However, the company claimed that the emails were classified as spam, and thus, not all of the accounts were compromised.<br><br>In March 2022, researchers from Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported on several large credential phishing campaigns that were conducted by APT28 against users of a Ukrainian media company (UkrNet), amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. The phishing email messages were sent from various compromised accounts and directed users to domains under the attackers' control. In some instances, the threat actors used Blogspot domains as initial landing sites that redirected users to credential harvesting pages. The observed phishing domains were blocked by Google.  <br><br>In April 2022, Microsoft announced that it shut down domains that were used by APT28 to attack Ukrainian entities during the Russo-Ukrainian War. In addition, they were used to target US and EU government institutions and think tanks that deal with foreign policy.  <br><br>In May 2022, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported on five active threat groups, including APT28, targeting organizations and individuals in Eastern Europe. APT28 specifically targeted Ukrainian users with phishing email messages with password-protected ZIP files. These files contained malicious .Net executables that were used to steal web browser cookies and saved passwords.<br><br>In addition, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) reported on an APT28 phishing campaign, in which the threat actors sent email messages impersonating the cybersecurity agency. The messages contained RAR archives with SFX files, distributing the malicious program CredoMap_v2. The program used HTTP POST requests to send stolen user credentials to a web resource, hosted on the Pipedream platform.   <br><br>On June 17, 2022, the German Attorney General issued an arrest warrant for the Russian hacker Nikolaj Kozachek (AKA ‚Äúblabla1234565‚Äù and ‚Äúkazak‚Äù), linked to APT28, for initiating a cyber espionage attack against the NATO think tank Joint Air Power Competence Center in Germany. According to the findings of the German authorities, in April 2017, Kozachek hacked the IT systems of the NATO think tank in Kalkar and installed a keylogger to steal sensitive information. The cyber campaign was assumed to be conducted on behalf of the Russian military intelligence service (GRU). <br><br>On June 20, 2022, the CERT-UA warned that APT28 was observed exploiting the Follina MSDT zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190), as part of a phishing campaign against critical infrastructure in Ukraine. The threat actors sent malicious documents exploiting the vulnerability to deploy Cobalt Strike and a previously unknown malware named CredoMap. CredoMap was found to be an information-stealing malware, gathering and exfiltrating web browser data, such as user credentials and cookies.            <br><br>On September 23, 2022, cybersecurity researchers reported a new code execution technique that has been employed by APT28. The technique involves the tracking of&nbsp;mouse movement over hyperlinks in Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, to trigger&nbsp;a malicious PowerShell script&nbsp;using the SyncAppvPublishingServer utility. The PowerShell script leads to the deployment of an encrypted DLL in the form of a JPEG file, which is executed through the&nbsp;rundll32.exe process. Then, another&nbsp;JPEG file is deployed and loaded into memory, leading to the download of the Graphite malware, which abuses the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for C2 communications to fetch additional payloads. This novel APT28&nbsp;technique enables the threat actors to infect systems without using traditional malicious macro codes.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>On the same day, Mandiant researchers connected APT28 to the activity of three Telegram channels, ‚ÄúXakNet Team,‚Äù ‚ÄúInfoccentr,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCyberArmyofRussia_Reborn.‚Äù The channels have been operated by&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">hacktivist groups of the same names that have&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements against Ukrainian entities. In addition, the hacktivist groups have used their Telegram channels to leak stolen data, some of which was obtained through APT28 campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>CISA recommends:<br> <br>Deploy an Enterprise Firewall<br>Organizations should deploy an enterprise firewall to control what is allowed in and out of their network. If the organization chooses not to deploy an enterprise firewall, it should work with the internet service provider to ensure that the firewall is configured properly.<br> <br>Block Unused Ports<br>Organizations should conduct a survey of the traffic in and out of their enterprise to determine the ports needed for organizational functions. They should then configure their firewall to block unnecessary ports. Organizations should develop a change control process to make control changes to those rules.

            "Overview": "At the beginning of 2022, the geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine reached a peak and started to crack into the cyberworld. <br><br>On January 14, 2022, Ukraine suffered an extensive cyberattack, in which 15 government websites were defaced. The websites displayed a message in Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish, stating that all the data on the computer was destroyed and mentioning some politically disputed Polish and Ukrainian regions. The Ukrainian government blamed the UNC1151 APT group (AKA Ghostwriter) for the campaign. The Belarusian state-sponsored group, presumably supported by Russia, was responsible for the Ghostwriter disinformation campaign that was initiated in March 2017. The campaign targeted European countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, with the aim of spreading narratives that object to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization‚Äôs (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe.<br><br>In addition to the aforementioned attack, various Ukrainian organizations were infected with a new malware, dubbed WhisperGate. The malware was disguised as ransomware, but in fact only acted to wipe the disk and cause damage. These attacks were attributed to a previously unknown threat actor, dubbed DEV-0586. The Secret Service of Ukraine confirmed that the two incidents are related and that the threat actors exploited the critical Log4j vulnerabilities in some of the attacks.<br><br>On February 8, 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine stated that they uncovered and dismantled two bot farms based in Lviv that were allegedly used for managing 18,000 fake mobile accounts. These accounts were directed from Russia to spread fake news across social media, in order to create panic among the Ukrainian population. <br><br>On February 15, 2022, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, later attributed to the Russian GRU, were initiated against Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Defense, Armed Forces, and two state-owned banks. The attacks caused interruptions in the web services of the targeted organizations. In addition, cybersecurity researchers reported that the Gamaredon group attempted to compromise an undisclosed Western government entity operating in Ukraine. This was done as part of a phishing campaign in which the threat actors leveraged a Ukrainian job search and employment platform to upload a malware downloader masquerading as a resume for a job ad that was posted by the targeted organization. <br><br>On February 23, 2022, Russia started its armed invasion of Ukraine, which was followed by another set of DDoS attacks hitting several Ukrainian government agencies and two of the largest state-owned banks in the country. These attacks are probably also a product of the Russian government, trying to rattle the stability of Ukraine in the country. At the same time, cybersecurity researchers discovered a new data wiping malware, dubbed HermeticWiper (AKA KillDisk.NCV), that infected hundreds of Ukrainian machines in the last two months. The malware disguises as a ransomware, dropping a ransom note with a political message, but in fact deletes the data that is stored on the infected machines and shuts them down.<br><br>On February 24, 2022, the Anonymous hacktivist group officially declared a cyberwar against the Russian government. Anonymous propagated DDoS attacks against websites belonging to the Russian government, state-owned media outlets, such as RT News, and national banks. The attacks forced the shutdown of hundreds of websites, with some of them displaying political messages criticizing Russia and supporting Ukraine. In addition, the attackers leaked information allegedly belonging to Russia and its supporters, such as the email accounts of Belarusian weapons maker, Tetraedr, that was accused of providing logistical support to Russia.<br><br>This attack was followed by a statement made by the Ukrainian Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhaylo Fedorov, calling for volunteers to join Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúIT army‚Äù and initiate cyberattacks against Russian entities.<br>  <br>On February 25, 2022, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) warned about a spear phishing campaign that was attributed to UNC1151, targeting Ukrainian armed forces personnel. The attackers compromised the email accounts of their targets and sent phishing messages to their contact list.<br><br>In addition, the CERT UA attributed the UAC-0056 threat group (AKA TA471) with an attack against a Ukrainian energy organization. The threat actors used spear phishing email messages, allegedly on behalf of the National Police of Ukraine, suggesting that a certain individual (Belous Alexei Sergeevich) had committed a crime. This attack was associated with a larger campaign that was initiated by the group against Ukrainian entities from the beginning of 2021.<br><br>Also on February 25, 2022, the Conti ransomware group announced its support for the Russian government's attack on Ukraine. In addition, the threat actors threatened to attack the critical infrastructure of countries acting against Russia. In response, a Ukrainian security researcher leaked over 60,000 internal messages belonging to the Conti ransomware operation. <br><br>On February 26, 2022, the Anonymous-affiliated group, Network Battalion 65' (NB65), announced that they hacked the Nuclear Safety Institute of Moscow, followed by a release of 40,000 files associated with the leak.  <br><br>On February 27, 2022, Anonymous announced that they breached the Belarusian railways, disrupting its services. The attack forced the Belarusian railways to switch to manual control mode, slowing down its operations.<br><br>In addition, the Russian-supporter Stormous group started shifting its focus towards Ukraine and US-based companies, publishing a leak from a Ukraine-based design company that creates drafts and plans for aircraft engines, followed by a leak from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a US-based company.<br><br>On February 28, 2022, Anonymous took down more than 1,500 websites of the Russian and Belarusian governments, state media outlets, banks, and companies.<br><br>On March 1, 2022, the AgainstTheWest hacker group, connected to Anonymous, claimed to hack the Russian state-owned Sberbank bank and threatened to leak its data, including DNS infrastructure, private keys for SSL, Sberbank API, CLI, and SDKs. In addition, the group hacked the Russian tool manufacturer NPKTAIR, a Russian financial holding (OJSC Ak Bars Holding), and a Russian plane tracking system. The latter hack enabled the group members to view important flights information and also change their details. <br><br>On the other side, Stormous announced its \"support for the Russian government\" stating: \"if any party in different parts of the world decides to organize a cyber-attack or cyber-attacks against Russia, we will be in the right direction and will make all our efforts to abandon the supplication of the West, especially the infrastructure.\" The group published a leak from a US-based fiberglass fabricator of composite-based products and parts for the military and commercial markets.<br><br>In addition, cybersecurity researchers reported on two novel malware that were used by Russian threat actors against Ukrainian entities. The first is IsaacWiper that was used to attack a Ukrainian government network and wipe its data. On some occasions, the malware was deployed alongside the RemCom remote access tool, which may imply a connection between both malware. The second reported malware is HermeticRansom (AKA PartyTicket, Elections GoRansom) that was observed to be distributed alongside the HermeticWiper malware, probably in an attempt to obscure the latter‚Äôs activity. Once deployed, the ransomware encrypts the files that are stored upon the victim‚Äôs computer, while dropping a ransomware note referencing a statement made by the United States President Joe Biden.<br><br>Furthermore, Proofpoint researchers reported on a phishing campaign, dubbed Asylum Ambuscade, that was likely conducted by nation-state sponsored threat actors targeting European government entities responsible for the logistics of the Ukrainian refugees (including transportation, budget allocation, administration, and population movement) within Europe. The campaign included the deployment of a Lua-based malware, named SunSeed. The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the campaign to the UNC1151 APT group (AKA Ghostwriter) that was previously observed targeting NATO personnel; however, the researchers noted that this attribution is not definite. <br><br>On March 2, 2022, the Anonymous-affiliated group, NB65, shut down the Control Center of the Russian Space Agency \"Roscosmos.\" In addition, another Anonymous-affiliated group, Ghost Squad, took down the Russian military air force website.<br><br>On the Russian end, Stormous announced they breached a school district in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition, it released login details of two US-based companies, an IT services company located in Palo Alto, California, and a company from the aerospace industry located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br><br>On March 3, 2022, Anonymous and its affiliates hacked and leaked the access to the phone directory of the military prosecutor's office of the southern military district of Russia, as well as documents from the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation. In addition, El Patron and other Anonymous affiliates took down the Russian news website lenta.ru.<br><br>On March 4, 2022, Anonymous announced that since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War they hacked more than 2,500 websites linked to the Russian and Belarusian governments, state-owned media outlets spreading disinformation, Russian private organizations, banks, hospitals, and airports.

In addition, the threat actors exploited known Microsoft vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-1636, CVE-2021-40444, and CVE-2022-30190) to gain system access.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 15, 2022, Cisco Talos researchers reported a new Gamaredon campaign targeting&nbsp;Ukrainian entities using a novel custom infostealer, likely a component of the Giddome backdoor. The malware was distributed using phishing email messages with macro-embedded Office documents that downloaded RAR archives with LNK files. The LNK files ran mshta.exe to&nbsp;download and parse a remote XML file that executed&nbsp;a malicious PowerShell script and led to the deployment of the information stealing malware. The malware could be used to exfiltrate&nbsp;specific files of interest and to deploy additional malware.<br></div><div><br></div><div>On September 19, 2022,&nbsp;cybersecurity researchers reported that the UAC-0113 threat group, linked to Sandworm, masqueraded as telecommunication providers to target Ukrainian entities. The threat actors sent their victims phishing email messages with links to spoofed domains. The domains contained Base64-encoded ISO files that were downloaded automatically using the HTML smuggling technique and distributed the Colibri Loader and Warzone RAT malware.</div><div><br></div><div>On September 23, 2022, Anonymous claimed to breach the Russian Ministry of Defense and leaked a 90 MB TXT file that allegedly contained the personal data of over 300,000 Russian individuals, who are likely to be mobilized in the army. The leaked file contained PII information, such as names, birth dates, regions, and districts of each individual.<br></div><div><br></div><div>On the same day, Mandiant researchers connected APT28 to the activity of three Telegram channels, ‚ÄúXakNet Team,‚Äù ‚ÄúInfoccentr,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCyberArmyofRussia_Reborn.‚Äù The channels have been operated by hacktivist groups of the same names that have conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements against Ukrainian entities. In addition, the hacktivist groups have used their Telegram channels to leak stolen data, some of which was obtained through APT28 campaigns.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></div>",

The red team penetration toolkit, sold at $2,500 for a yearly license, is used by organizations to perform security testing; however, threat actors (e.g. APT29) have adopted it for malicious purposes in various campaigns targeting organizations from multiple sectors and countries, such as Argentina and Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Like other C2 frameworks, Brute Ratel enables its users to deploy ‚ÄúBadgers‚Äù (similar to Cobalt Strike beacons) on remote hosts. These badgers connect back to the operator's C2 server to receive and execute commands. In addition, Brute Ratel can be used to create Windows system services, upload and download files, scan network ports, take screenshots, load shellcodes, and more. The tool is considered to be very stealthy and was specifically designed to evade detection by EDR and antivirus solutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Brute Ratel was observed being deployed using an ISO file, likely sent through phishing messages. The ISO file contained a Windows shortcut (LNK) file, a legitimate copy of Microsoft OneDrive Updater, and a malicious payload DLL that loaded a Brute Ratel badger into the RuntimeBroker.exe process using the DLL search order hijacking technique. This enabled the toolkit operators to remotely access the compromised device, execute commands, and further spread in the network. Brute Ratel was also observed being loaded by the Bumblebee loader and used for post-exploitation activities. This, as part of the lateral movement phase that might lead to network encryption using ransomware payloads.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Brute Ratel is only sold to registered companies and individuals with an official business email address/domain; however, threat actors might buy black market licenses or set up fake companies to be used as part of the verification process.</div>",

The metaMain backdoor can be used to maintain long-term system access, log user keystrokes, download and upload arbitrary files, execute shellcode, take screenshots, and decrypt Mafalda in memory. Mafalda is a heavily obfuscated malware framework that supports 67 commands, including various file operations, network reconnaissance, registry manipulation, and data exfiltration. In addition, Metador was observed using another custom implant, Cryshell, for bouncing connections in an internal network to external command and control (C2) servers, and an unknown Linux malware that gathers information from other connected machines in the compromised network and transfers them back to Mafalda. To evade detection, Metador uses segmentation of the attack infrastructure, i.e. using a single IP address per victim for C2 communications over either HTTP or raw TCP. The group‚Äôs servers are hosted on LiteServer, a Dutch hosting provider.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Based on the documentation for Mafalda's commands, it seems that Metador‚Äôs malware are developed by one set of individuals, but operated by another.&nbsp;</div>",

            "Overview": "<div>The Erbium information stealing malware, first reported by cybersecurity researchers in September 2022, has been promoted on underground hacking forums since July 2022. The malware-as-a-service (MaaS) targets organizations and individuals around the world, in countries such as the United States, France, Colombia, Spain, Italy, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Erbium can potentially have a wide range of targets, as it is sold for a relatively low price of $100 per month or $1000 for a yearly license.</div><div><br></div><div>Erbium, written in Visual C++, is primarily distributed through drive-by downloads of fake cheats and cracks; however, it can also be distributed through spear phishing, malicious advertising, exploit kits, and malware loaders, such as SmokeLoader and Private Loader. The infostealer is deployed in a modular fashion, starting with a first-stage 32-bit PE executable with a highly obfuscated code that uses polymorphic techniques to change its identifiable features and evade detection. The first stage executable allocates memory in a new process and leads to the download of a second-stage implant that connects to the command and control (C2) server over HTTP and fetches the final DLL file. The DLL is loaded and executed in the memory of the legitimate process, AppLaunch.exe, and acts as the stealer itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Erbium can collect general system information (e.g. geolocation, Windows version, PC name, and number of monitors), web browser data (e.g. cookies, user credentials, history, and autofill), cryptocurrency information, Steam and Telegram authorization files, Discord tokens, and two-factor authentication codes from various browser-based authenticators. In addition, the infostealer can load other libraries, processes, and DLLs in memory, enumerate drives, paths, files, and folders, and take screenshots. At the end of the collection process, the harvested data is exfiltrated to a remote command and control (C2) server through a built-in API system. The stolen information is presented on a dedicated control panel that is connected to the malware through three different URLs, including Discord's Content Delivery Network (CDN).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",
