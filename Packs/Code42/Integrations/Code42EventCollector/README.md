Code42 Insider Risk software solutions provide the right balance of transparency, technology and training to detect and appropriately respond to data risk. Use the Code42EventCollector integration to fetch file events and audit logs.

This is the default integration for this content pack when configured by the Data Onboarder in Cortex XSIAM.

## Configure Code42 Event Collector on Cortex XSIAM

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Configurations** > **Data Collection** > **Automation & Feed Integrations**.
2. Search for Code42 Event Collector.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Server URL (e.g., https://api.us.code42.com, see help section) | True |
    | API Client ID | True |
    | API Client Secret | True |
    | Maximum number of file events per fetch | True |
    | Maximum number of audit events per fetch | True |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.


## Code42 Event Collector Authentication

Code42 API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization.

The domain used for making API requests can be determined using the domain you use to log in to the Code42 console.

| Console Domain      | API Domain         |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| console.us.code42.com | api.us.code42.com  |
| console.us2.code42.com | api.us2.code42.com |
| console.ie.code42.com | api.ie.code42.com  |
| console.gov.code42.com | api.gov.code42.com |


For each request sent to the API, a bearer token will be requested to authenticate your action. The bearer token should be renewed each 15 minutes. This is done automatically by the integration.

You can retrieve your API credentials by following the instructions in the [Code 42 documentation](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827617150231).

## Code42 Event Collector Rate Limits
The Code42 API can handle up to 120 requests per minute. After that the API will start to decline client's requests.

The integration with the default configuration should not raise any rate-limits.


## Code42 Event Collector Required Scopes
To use the Code42 Event Collector, make sure you have the correct [product plan](https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827648467351-About-Code42-product-plans) which must include full Code42 API access.


## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
