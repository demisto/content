## Code42

Code42 provides simple, fast detection and response to everyday data loss from insider threats by focusing on customer data on endpoints and the cloud.

To configure this integration, you will need to [create an API Client](https://support.code42.com/Incydr/Admin/Code42_console_reference/API_clients) within the Code42 console with the following permissions:

* Users (Read/Write)
* Detection Lists (Read/Write)
* Alerts (Read/Write)
* File Events (Read)
* Device (Read)

After this API Client is set up, use the API Client ID and Secret (in the "password" field) to configure the Code42 integration.
