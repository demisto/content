## Code42

Code42 provides simple, fast detection and response to everyday data loss from insider threats by focusing on customer data on endpoints and the cloud.

To configure this integration, you will need to create a local (non-SSO) user within the Code42 application with one of the following sets of roles:

* Customer Cloud Admin
* Security Center User + (Org Security Viewer or Cross Org Security Viewer)

After this user is set up, use the username and password to configure the Code42 integration.
