## Overview
---

Code42 provides simple, fast detection and response to everyday data loss from insider threats by focusing on customer data on endpoints and the cloud to answer questions like:

* Where is my data?
* Where has my data been?
* When did my data leave?
* What data exactly left my organization?

This integration was integrated and tested with the fully-hosted SaaS implementation of Code42 and requires a Platinum level subscription.

## Code42 Playbook
---

## Use Cases
---

* Ingesting File Exfiltration alerts from Code42
* Management of Departing Employees within Code42
* General file event and metadata search

## Configure Code42 on Demisto
---

1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for Code42.
3. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __credentials__
    * __Code42 Console URL for the pod your Code42 instance is running in__: This defaults to console.us.code42.com for U.S. SaaS Pod customers; replace with the domain that you use to log into your Code42 console if located in a different SaaS pod.
    * __Fetch incidents__: Check this box to enable fetching of incidents
    * __Incident type__: Select which Demisto incident type to map ingested Code42 alerts to
    * __Alert severities to fetch when fetching incidents__: If desired, select which Alert severities to ingest.
    * __First fetch time range (&lt;number&gt; &lt;time unit&gt;, e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes)__: When first run, how long to go back to retrieve alerts.
    * __Alerts to fetch per run; note that increasing this value may result in slow performance if too many results are returned at once__: Alerts to fetch and process per run. Setting this value too high may have a negative impact on performance.
    * __Include the list of files in returned incidents.__: If checked, will also fetch the file events associated with the alert.
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
