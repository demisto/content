#### Integrations

##### Code42

- The following commands were deprecated with no available replacement:
   - ***code42-user-block***
   - ***code42-user-unblock***
   - ***code42-user-create***
- Fixed an issue where some incidents were not ingested.
   - As a result of this bugfix, it is possible that in some rare cases, duplicate incidents will be ingested on the first fetch run after the update to this version.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py42:1.0.0.3708131*.
- The *console_url* parameter is no longer required and has been hidden following internal improvements.
