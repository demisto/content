This script converts an input value into another value using two lists. The input value or range is searched in the first list (map_from). 
If it exists, the value at the same index from the second list (map_to) is returned. If there is no match, the original value is returned.

Example 1:

map_from = "1,2,3,4"
map_to = "4,3,2,1"
value = 3

Output is "2"

Example 2:

map_from = "1-3,4"
map_to = "5,1"
value = 3

Output is "5"
