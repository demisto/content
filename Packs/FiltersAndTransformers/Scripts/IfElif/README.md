### A transformer for if-elif-else logic.

The **If-Elif** transformer simulates a python *"if elif else"* tree using a JSON provided in the ***conditions*** argument.
The JSON should be a list of dictionaries where all have the keys "*condition*", which holds a boolean expression, and "*return*", which holds the value to return if "*condition*" is evaluated to be true. To return a default value if all "*condition*"s were false, the last dictionary should have only the key "default" holding the valid JSON value. If this is not provided an empty string will be returned as a default.
In order to prevent injections Context values should be retrieved from the value entered in the ***value (Get)*** of the transformer with the hash-curly brackets `#{...}` syntax. This syntax has the same behavior as the classic XSOAR `${...}` syntax and uses the [Cortex XSOAR Transform Language (DT)](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/dt). To provide the full context to the transformer, use `${.}` as the ***value (Get)*** argument.

#### Supported operators for conditions:

**Comparison operators** work like Python operators:
| Operator | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal | x == y |
| != | Not equal | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| < | Less than | x < y |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y |
| in | In | x in y|
| not in | Not in | x not in y|

**Logical operators** also follow the Python syntax:
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| and | Returns True if both statements are true | x < 5 and x < 10 |
| or | Returns True if one of the statements is true | x < 5 or x < 4 |
| not | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) |

**Regular expressions** are implemented with the "regex_match" function, in the format: `regex_match('pattern', 'string')`. The behavior of the function is controlled with the ***flags*** argument.

**Literal strings** should preferably be surrounded by single quotes. Please do _not_ use `#{...}` in a string, instead, use the `+` operator. For example: `'first ' + #{second.string} + ' third'` will be equal to the common `"first ${second.string} third"`.

### Example:
---
##### value (Get):
```
${.}
```

##### conditions:
```json
[
  {
    "condition": "'www.' + #{domain.name} + '.com' not in #{approved.sites}",
    "return": #{domain.name}
  },
  {
    "condition": "#{number} >= 5 and #{path.to.string} == 'Yes'",
    "return": "valid"
  },
  {
    "condition": "regex_match('\d+', #{some.value})",
    "return": #{value.to.return}
  },
  {
    "else": #{default.value}
  }
]
```

##### flags:
```
case_insensitive,regex_dot_all,regex_multiline
```


## Script Data

---

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Script Type | python3 |
| Tags | transformer, general |
| Cortex XSOAR Version | 6.9.0 |

## Inputs

---

| **Argument Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| value | The object from which to grab values, for the full context use "$\{.\}" |
| conditions | A JSON formatted list, where all but the last items are dictionaries with the keys "condition" (holding a boolean expression) and "return" (holding the value to return if "condition" is true).<br/>The last dictionary should have the key "else" which can hold any valid JSON object to return if no "condition" was true. |
| flags | Flags to control comparison and regular expression behavior. Possible values are: case_insensitive, regex_dot_all, regex_multiline, regex_full_match |
