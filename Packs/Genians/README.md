Use the Genian NAC integration to block IP addresses using the assign tag.

Genian NAC network sensing technology powered by Device Platform Intelligence (DPI) discovers
and presents all detected devicesâ€™ business contextual and risk-related information along with
their technical information without disturbing existing network infrastructure.
The resulting intelligence enhances visibility and allows operators to detect and respond
to any non-compliant or compromised devices in real time.

With the result of comprehensive network visibility, Genian NAC can ensure compliance from all connected
devices by leveraging Virtual In-Line Packet Inspection which operates at Layer 2.
This technology has complete control over endpoint device traffic over TCP and UDP
by eliminating the need for complex configurations and network changes.
