To find policy and rule IDs by which you can filter, run the 'forescout-get-policies' command.

Enter fields with their associated values in the following format, '{field_1}={val_1}&{field_2}={val_2} … &{field_n}={val_n}' where '{field_1}' through '{field_n}' are replaced by actual field names and '{val_1}' through '{val_n}' are replaced by the desired matching values. Note that a list field may be specified with the values separated by commas. Only hosts whose properties match all the specified values will be returned. For a list of potential host fields that may be specified, try executing the 'forescout-get-hostfields' command. A composite property may also be specified. If entered in the format where all the field-value pairs are in a single set of square brackets, for example, '{composite_prop}=[{field_1},{val_1},..,{field_n},{val_n}]' then only hosts for which the specified composite property's fields all match the values entered will be returned. If entered in the format, '{composite_prop}=[{field_1},{val}_1],..,[{field_n},{val_n}]' where each field-value pair is enclosed in its own set of brackets, then hosts for which the composite property contains any of the field-values specified will be returned. Note that for composite properties, sub-fields should be entered as their internal representation in Forescout. To find internal representation for a composite property's sub-fields try executing 'forescout-get-host' command with the host specified in the 'identifier' argument and the name of the composite property entered in the 'fields'  argument of the command.
