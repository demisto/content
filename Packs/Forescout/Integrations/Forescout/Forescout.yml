        command. If multiple policy and/or rule IDs are entered, only hosts that are
        selected by all of the policies and/or rules specifed will be returned. Multiple

        actual field names and '{val_1}' through '{val_n}' are replaced by the desired
        matching values. Note that a list field may be specified with the values separated
        by commas. Only hosts whose properties match all the specified values will
        be returned. For a list of potential host fields that may be specified, try
        executing the 'forescout-get-hostfields' command. A composite property may
        also be specified. If entered in the format where all the field-value pairs
        are in a single set of square brackets, for example, '{composite_prop}=[{field_1},{val_1},..,{field_n},{val_n}]'
        then only hosts for which the specified composite property's fields all match
        the values entered will be returned. If entered in the format, '{composite_prop}=[{field_1},{val}_1],..,[{field_n},{val_n}]'

        for which the composite property contains any of the field-values specified
        will be returned. Note that for composite properties, sub-fields should be
        entered as their internal representation in Forescout. To find internal representation
        for a composite property's sub-fields try executing 'forescout-get-host' command
        with the host specified in the 'identifier' argument and the name of the composite
        property entered in the 'fields'  argument of the command.
