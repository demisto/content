#### Playbooks

##### Default
- Fixed a bug where the playbook was submitting invalid data for URL detonation, causing errors in certain cases.
- Fixed a bug where the playbook was using the older Detonate URL - Generic playbook, which, when VirusTotal was enabled, would result in an error due to usage of a removed command.
- Improved the overall performance of the playbook.
- Updated the limit of incidents for deduplication to 50 from 200.
- Changed the order in which playbook tasks are executed, so that indicators are extracted from the file before endpoints are searched for the hash. The idea behind  this change is that if new hashes are extracted from the file, they would be searched as well.
