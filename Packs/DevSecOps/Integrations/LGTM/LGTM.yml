    - description: The `callback-secret` is used to compute a signature which is included in the `x-lgtm-signature` header of the callback response. The receiver of the callback can check the validity of the response by computing the signature using HMAC-SHA1 and verifying that it matches the `x-lgtm-signature` header value. The HMAC algorithm requires byte sequences as inputs for both the secret and the message. The callback secret string must be converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding. The response body should ideally be read as a plain byte sequence. Conversion to, for example a JSON object, and back to a byte sequence might change the formatting, and would invalidate the signature.
