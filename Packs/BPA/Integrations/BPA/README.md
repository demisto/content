Palo Alto Networks Best Practice Assessment (BPA) analyzes NGFW and Panorama configurations and compares them to the best practices.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 1.0 of BPA.
Supported Cortex XSOAR versions: 5.0.0 and later.

## Configure BPA on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for BPA.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | server | Panorama Server URL \(e.g., https://192.168.0.1\) | True |
    | key | Panorama API Key | True |
    | token | BPA Access Token | True |
    | insecure | Trust any certificate \(not secure\) | False |
    | proxy | Use system proxy settings | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

For example, at the start of a session, the firewall identifies Facebook traffic as web-browsing traffic, but after examining a few packets, the firewall refines the application to Facebook-base. Use “Log at Session Start” only to troubleshoot packet flow and related issues, or for tunnel session logs (only logging at session start shows active GRE tunnels in the Application Command Center). | ['https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/81/best-practices/best-practices-data-center/data-center-best-practice-security-policy/log-and-monitor-data-center-traffic/what-data-center-traffic-to-log-and-monitor'] | Log at Start of Session | Policies |

Configure Log Forwarding for the traffic that matches each Security policy rule. You can create profiles that send logs to a dedicated storage device such as Panorama in Log Collector mode, a syslog or SNMP server, or to an email profile, to provide redundant storage for the logs on the firewall and a long-term repository for older logs. You can create profiles to forward logs to one or more external storage devices to remain in compliance, run analytics, and review abnormal activity, threat behaviors, and long-term patterns. | ['https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/81/pan-os/pan-os/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding'] | Log Forwarding | Policies |
