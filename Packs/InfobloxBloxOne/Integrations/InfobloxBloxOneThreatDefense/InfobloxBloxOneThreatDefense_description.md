### Creating Service API Key

You can create multiple service API keys that are associated with respective service API keys for specific purposes. You must have the required permission to create service API keys. For information, see [Configuring Service API Key](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/BloxOneCloud/35430173).

To create a service API key, complete the following:

1. From the SSO portal, click **User Access** from the left navigation panel and then click the **Service API Keys** tab.

2. On the Service API Keys tab, click **Create**.

3. In the Create Service API Keys dialog, complete the following:

  - **Name**: Enter the name of the user API key. Use a name that can identify the purpose of the key.

  - **Service User**: Enter the name of the service users or choose one from the drop-down list. You can associate up to 10 service API keys per service user.

  - **Expires at**: Click the calendar icon to select a date and time when the service API key should expire. This date determines the duration of key validity.

4. Click **Save & Close** to save the configuration. The new service API key is generated.

5. In the API Access Key Generated dialog, click **Copy** to copy the key and save it in a place where you can locate the key in the future.

### Instance Configuration

2. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
3. To fetch Infoblox SOC Insights or DNS Security Events as an incidents in XSOAR, select the option `Fetches incidents` and follow the table to update configuration parameters.
