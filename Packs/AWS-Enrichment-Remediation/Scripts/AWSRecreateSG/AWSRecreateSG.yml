comment: Automation to determine which interface on an EC2 instance has an over-permissive security group, determine which security groups have over-permissive rules, and replace them with a copy of the security group that has only the over-permissive portion removed.  Over-permissive is defined as sensitive ports (SSH, RDP, etc) being exposed to the internet via IPv4.
