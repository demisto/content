## **AWS Credentials Rotation Playbook**

### **Identity Remediation**
Secure compromised accounts by taking swift action:
- **Reset Password**: Resets the user password to halt any unauthorized access.

- **Access Key Deactivation**: Deactivate any suspicious or known-compromised access keys.

- **Combo Action**: In some cases, you may want to reset both the password and deactivate the access key for absolute security.

### **Role Remediation**
If a role is suspected to be compromised:
- **Deny Policy Implementation**: Attach a deny-all policy to the compromised role, thus preventing it from performing any further actions.

- **Role Cloning**: Before outright remediation, clone the role. This ensures that you have a backup with the same permissions, making transition smoother.
