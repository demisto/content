##### Abnormal Security

- Fixed an issue with the **abnormal-security-submit_false_positive_report** command by removing an extra semicolon in the *portal_link* argument
- Fixed an issue in the **abnormal-security-submit_false_negative_report** command where the *recipient_email* argument did not work as expected.
