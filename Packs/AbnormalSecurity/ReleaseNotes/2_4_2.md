##### Abnormal Security

- Fixed an issue where the integration would abort incident fetching when encountering an API error for a single entity (threat, abuse campaign, or account takeover case). Skippable 4xx errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 410 Gone) are now logged and the entity is skipped, allowing remaining incidents to be fetched. Systemic errors (401, 403, 429) are still raised immediately.
