## Abnormal Security

To configure an instance of Abnormal Security integration in Cortex XSOAR:

1. Provide 'Server URL'. The default server URL should be sufficient for most cases.

2. Provide 'API Key':

    Retrieve your authentication token via the [Abnormal Portal](https://portal.abnormalsecurity.com/home/settings/integrations)

    Keep the token safe, as it grants access to sensitive threat data related to your organization. Store it in a secure place, such as an encrypted password vault, and do not share it unless absolutely necessary. If you feel that the token has been compromised, please contact your Account Manager immediately.
