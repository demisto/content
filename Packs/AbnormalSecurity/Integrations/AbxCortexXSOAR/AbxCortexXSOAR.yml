description: "This is the specification for Abnormal Security Client API which can\
  \ be used for managing security threats detected by Abnormal Security.  h2 Who is\
  \ this API for? /h2  This API is for managing threats to an organization identified\
  \ by Abnormal Security. The organization should be integrated with Abnormal Security\
  \ and enabled for real-time detection of malicious emails.  h2  Integration Steps\
  \  /h2   h3  Step 1: Generating the authentication token  /h3   Reach out to your\
  \ Account Manager who can configure your access token and provide it to you securely.\
  \ You will use this token to view and modify your Abnormal-detected threats and\
  \ cases.  Keep the token safe, as it grants access to sensitive threat data related\
  \ to your organization. Store it in a secure place, such as an encrypted password\
  \ vault, and do not share it unless absolutely necessary. If you feel that the token\
  \ has been compromised, please contact your Account Manager immediately.  Once obtained,\
  \ the token can be used in a request from any HTTP client, such as cURL:  pre  curl\
  \ -H \"Authorization: Bearer     ACCESS_TOKEN   \" https://api.abnormalplatform.com/v1/threats\
  \  /pre    h3  Step 2: IP whitelisting  /h3   IP whitelisting ensures that API access\
  \ is only possible from IP addresses explicitly belonging to your organization.\
  \ It prevents users from unauthorized networks to access your Abnormal SOAR data.\
  \ This second layer of security helps keep your data safe from unauthorized users,\
  \ and protects you in the event of a token compromise.  To whitelist your organization\u2019\
  s IPs, please provide your Account Manager with specific IPv4 / IPv6 addresses,\
  \ or a range of addresses using a  a href=\"https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr\"\
  \  CIDR block /a . "
