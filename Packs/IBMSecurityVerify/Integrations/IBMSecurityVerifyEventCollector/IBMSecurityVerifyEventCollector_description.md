## IBM Security Verify Event Collector

The integration is designed for customers using IBM Security Verify to collect and analyze security events across their organization's network. By connecting to the IBM Security Verify Event Collector, organizations can effectively monitor, manage, and respond to potential security incidents in real-time.

The API Credentials include a combination of **Client ID** and **Token ID**. These credentials are equivalent to a username and password and should be handled with care. It is strongly recommended to keep the **Client ID** and **Token ID** secure and not share them with unauthorized parties to prevent potential security breaches.

To obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, navigate to the IBM Security Verify UI and select **Security > API Access**. Then, click on **Add API Client** to generate the credentials needed for integration.
