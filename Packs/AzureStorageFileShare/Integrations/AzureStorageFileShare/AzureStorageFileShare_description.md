To configure an instance of the integration in Cortex XSOAR, you need to supply your Storage Account Name and Storage Account SAS Token.
When you configure the integration instance, enter the Storage Account name in the Storage Account field, and the Storage Account SAS Token in the Account SAS Token field.

To create and copy your storage account SAS Token you have to:

1. Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
2. Under the Settings section please select 'Shared access signature' option.
3. In the Shared Access Signature window, make the following selections:

* Specify the signed key Start and Expiry date and time.
* Select the Time zone for the Start and Expiry date and time (default is Local).
* Define your Permissions by checking and/or clearing the appropriate check box.
  1. Allow the 'Blob' and 'File' services.
  2. Allow the 'Service' and 'Object' resource types.
  3. Please allow the following permissions: 'Read', 'Write', 'Delete', 'List', 'Create', 'Add', 'Update' and 'Immutable storage' in order to be able to achieve all integration use-cases.
  4. Please allow 'Blob versioning permissions'
* Review and select "Generate".

A new window will appear with the SAS token.

Copy and paste the SAS token. Note it will only be displayed once and can't be retrieved once the window is closed.
