##### CVE-2022-41040 & CVE-2022-41082 - ProxyNotShell
A new method for bypassing ProxyNotShell mitigations was found after being seen exploited in the wild by the Play ransomware gang.
While the original exploit took advantage of the Autodiscover endpoint, the new exploit is using the OWA endpoint leading to SSRF.

This playbook introduces several updates in response to the new discovery:
- Hunting:
    - Detecting possibly successful exploitation of the OWA SSRF vulnerability.
- Mitigations:
    - IIS URL Rewrite rule for the modified exploitation URI path. (**Note: This rule hasn't been tested.**)
- Remediation:
    - Block Indicators - Generic v3 playbook.
