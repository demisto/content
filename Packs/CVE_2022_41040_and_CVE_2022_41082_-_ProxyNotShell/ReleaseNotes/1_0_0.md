##### New: CVE-2022-41040 & CVE-2022-41082 - ProxyNotShell
- Microsoft is investigating two reported zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, and Exchange Server 2019. The first one, identified as CVE-2022-41040, is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, and the second one, identified as CVE-2022-41082, allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker.  

Currently, Microsoft is aware of limited targeted attacks using these two vulnerabilities.  In these attacks, CVE-2022-41040 can enable an authenticated attacker to remotely trigger CVE-2022-41082. It should be noted that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is necessary to successfully exploit either vulnerability.

This playbook includes the following tasks:

* Collect detection rules, indicators and mitigation tools.
* Exploitation patterns hunting using Cortex XDR - XQL Engine.
* Exploitation patterns hunting using 3rd party SIEM products:
    * Azure Sentinel
    * Splunk
    * QRadar
    * Elasticsearch
* Indicators hunting using:
    * PAN-OS
    * Splunk
    * QRadar
* Provides Microsoft mitigation and detection capabilities.
