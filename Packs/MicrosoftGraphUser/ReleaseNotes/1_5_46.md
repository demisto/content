##### Azure Active Directory Users

- Added support for **msgraph-user-account-disable-quick-action** command that disables a user from all office 365 applications, and prevents sign in. note: this command disables user,
but does not terminate an existing session. supported only in a self deployed app flow with the
permission: directory.accessasuser.all(delegated).
