  additionalinfo: Incremental feeds pull only new or modified indicators that have been sent from the integration. The determination if the indicator is new or modified happens on the 3rd-party vendor's side, so only indicators that are new or modified are sent to Cortex XSOAR. Therefore, all indicators coming from these feeds are labeled new or modified.
