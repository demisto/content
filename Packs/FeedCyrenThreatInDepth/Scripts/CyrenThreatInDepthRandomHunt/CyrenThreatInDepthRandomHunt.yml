comment: 'This script will take a random Cyren Threat InDepth feed indicator and its relationships and create a threat hunting incident for you.


  The main query parameters for the resulting, internal indicator query are:


  1. Seen for the first time by the feed source within the last 7 days.

  2. No investigation on it yet.

  3. Must have relationships to other indicators.'
