The underlying Cyren Threat InDepth API provides you with an incremental feed, meaning it provides new
or modified indicators. It also works with an offset value that keeps track of your currently processed
indicators. Your current offset defaults at the globally known maximum offset on your first setup and
is being stored and updated for you in the integration instance context. The integration then uses the
"Maximum number of indicators" parameter as the count in each request. It is recommended to set it to
a high enough value so that you get all the feed indicators for maximum product value, to handle bursts
etc. (the value cannot be higher than 100.000 and it will be capped at that value if you set a higher one).

In case you want to want to reset the offset value, use the `cyren-threat-indepth-reset-client-offset` command.

You can retrieve the current offset value using the `cyren-threat-indepth-get-client-offset` command.
