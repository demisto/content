      description: List the most seen domains in Umbrella. The popularity list contains Cisco Umbrella most queried domains based on passive DNS usage across Umbrella global network. The metric does not only consist of browser-based http requests from users but also takes into account the number of unique client IPs invoking this domain relative to the sum of all requests to all domains. The ranking reflects the domain's relative internet activity agnostic to the invocation protocols and applications where as site ranking models (such as Alexa) focus on the web activity over port 80 (primarily from browsers). In addition, the Umbrella popularity algorithm also applies data normalization techniques to smooth potential biases that may occur due to sampling of DNS usage data.
