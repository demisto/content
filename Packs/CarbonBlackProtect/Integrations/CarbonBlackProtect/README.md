### cbp-fileCatalog-search
***
Search for file catalogs. See more: https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/enterprise-protection/8.0/rest-api/#filecatalog


#### Base Command

`cbp-fileCatalog-search`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group | Grouping is optional and can be defined with a single attribute: &amp;group=xyz. There can be only one grouping field. Example: group=osShortName. | Optional | 
| limit | (Int) Is maximum number of results to retrieve. If not specified: First 1000 results will be returned. If set to -1: Only result count will be returned, without actual results. Offset parameter is ignored in this case. If set to 0: All results will be returned. Offset parameter is ignored in this case.
