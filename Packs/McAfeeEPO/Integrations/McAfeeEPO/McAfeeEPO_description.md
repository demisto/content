## Mcafee ePO Help

McAfee ePO has a highly flexible and powerful permissions system. The permissions required for the user that uses this integration depend on which operations they need to perform. The API user should have the same permissions a regular user would have in order to access the data via the UI. It is possible to view the exact permissions needed for a specific command by running the !epo-help command. The !epo-help command's output will include help information for the specific command including required permissions.
