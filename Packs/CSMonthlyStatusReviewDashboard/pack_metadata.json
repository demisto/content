Create Core REST API integration on Main Tenant and use the API Key you created in previous step.\nOn instance settings define in URL field https://127.0.0.1\nmake sure not to set the tenant name in the URL.\n3. Propagate Core REST API instance to All tenants or to the required tenant using propagation labels.\n\n##How To:\n1. Once the pack is installed successfully, if you are on XSOAR version 6.x use 'Monthly Status Review Dashboard v6' dashboard else use  'Monthly Status Review Dashboard v8'\n2.
