  - arguments:
    - description: |
        The start date for filtering events. Events newer than or equal to this date will be retrieved.
        Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS` format (e.g., `10-07-2025 14:17:46`).
      name: start_date
      required: true
    - description: |
        The number of days to include events after the `start_date`. For example, if `start_date` is 
        '10-07-2025 10:00:00' and `days_from_start` is '2', events will be retrieved up to '12-07-2025 10:00:00'.
        It's recommended to keep this value no more than 5 days to avoid very large result sets.
      defaultValue: '2'
      name: days_from_start
      required: false
    - description: |
        Set to true to create events in your system from the retrieved data. 
        If false (default), the command will only display the events without creating them.

      auto: PREDEFINED  
    - description: |
        The maximum number of events to retrieve. If more events match the criteria, only this
        specified amount will be returned.
