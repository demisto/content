Rundeck is a runbook automation for incident management, business continuity, and self-service operations. The integration enables you to install software on a list of machines or perform a task periodically. Can be used when there is a new attack and you want to perform an update of the software to block the attack.
If you want to use Rundeck in Cortex XSOAR but don't have Rundeck set up yet, follow the instructions in the installation guide (https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/administration/install/).


If you already have Rundeck, to use it in Cortex XSOAR you need to get:
- Token: You can generate a new token or use one you already have. Follow this link to learn how to get a token: https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/10-user.html#profile
- Project Name: To configure a default project to work with, go to Rundeck and in the navigation bar choose 'Projects'. Choose a project from the list that appears. 
- URL: A link to your Rundeck site.
