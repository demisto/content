## Twitter v2 Integration Help

#### How to configure
In order to configure Twitterv2 you will need a Bearer Token. To get your Bearer Token you need to: 

   1. [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
   2. Create a Twitter App.

 Once you have those, you'll also need to obtain the Bearer Token found in the developer portal. 

1. Login to your Twitter account on developer.twitter.com.
2. Navigate to the Twitter App dashboard and open the Twitter App for which you would like to generate access tokens.
3. Navigate to the *keys and tokens* page. You'll find the Bearer Token on this page.
