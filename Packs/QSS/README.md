Q-SCMP provides advanced SIEM events lifecycle management. It achieves this by streamlining all core Security Operations Center (SOC) as well as cyber incident response processes. 
In combination with automated threat intelligence, incident response would be taken a step further by providing more insights about cyber threats. By automating and streamlining SOC 
processes for the effective management of the complete lifecycle of security alerts, Q-SCMP ensures SOC consistent efficiency and effectiveness.
