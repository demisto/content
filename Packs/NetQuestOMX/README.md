WAN Signals Probe (WSP) - auto-discovers & targets traffic in OTN/SDH/SONET links

## What does this pack do?
Using the NetQuest OMX integration you can:

- Uploads a .txt file with address list to the appliance. The appliance temporarily stores the file until it is saved to the Library and replaces any previously loaded list file.
- Optimize Updated Address List - If the traffic elements are IP addresses, the integration should optimize the list by compressing IP addresses into CIDR groups.
- Create a new address list.
- Changing the name of an exists list.  
- Delete an exists list.
- Fetch events every period of time. Available only in Cortex XSIAM.
