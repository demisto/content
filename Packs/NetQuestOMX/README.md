NetQuestâ€™s products are high-capacity service nodes that help security teams access and analyze network traffic.
Powerful packet and flow processing features assist security tools in detecting and mitigating security threats as cost effectively as possible. 
Key product capabilities include:
- Streaming Network Sensor (SNS) - converts traffic to standard or L7-enriched IPFIX flow data.
- Packet Services Broker (PSB) - classifies and optimizes packet flows sent to security tools.
- WAN Signals Probe (WSP) - auto-discovers and targets traffic in OTN/SDH/SONET links.

## What does this pack do?
Using the NetQuest OMX integration you can:

- Upload a .txt file with address list to the appliance. The appliance temporarily stores the file until it is saved to the Library and replaces any previously loaded list file.
- Optimize updated address list. If the traffic elements are IP addresses, the integration will optimize the list by compressing IP addresses into CIDR groups.
- Create a new address list.
- Change the name of an existing address list.  
- Delete an exists list.
- Fetch events every period of time. Available only in Cortex XSIAM.
