## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### splunk-results

***
Returns the results of a previous Splunk search. You can use this command in conjunction with the splunk-job-create command.

#### Base Command

`splunk-results`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sid | ID of the search for which to return results. | Required | 
| limit | The maximum number of returned results per search. To retrieve all results, enter "0" (not recommended). Default is 100. | Optional | 

#### Context Output

There is no context output for this command.
### splunk-search

***
Searches Splunk for events. For human readable output, the table command is supported in the query argument. For example, `query=" * | table field1 field2 field3"` will generate a table with field1, field2, and field3 as headers.

#### Base Command

`splunk-search`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| query | The Splunk search language string to execute. For example: "index=* \| head 3". . | Required | 
| earliest_time | Specifies the earliest time in the time range to search. The time string can be a UTC time (with fractional seconds), a relative time specifier (to now), or a formatted time string. Default is 1 week ago, in the format "-7d". You can also specify time in the format: 2014-06-19T12:00:00.000-07:00. | Optional | 
| latest_time | Specifies the latest time in the time range to search. The time string can be a UTC time (with fractional seconds), a relative time specifier (to now), or a formatted time string. For example: "2014-06-19T12:00:00.000-07:00" or "-3d" (for 3 days ago). | Optional | 
| event_limit | Maximum number of events to return. Default is 100. If "0", all results are returned. | Optional | 
| batch_limit | The maximum number of returned results to process at a time. For example, if 100 results are returned, and you specify a batch_limit of 10, the results will be processed 10 at a time over 10 iterations. This does not effect the search or the context and outputs returned. In some cases, specifying a batch_size enhances search performance. If you think that the search execution is suboptimal, we recommend trying several batch_size values to determine which works best for your search. Default is 25,000. Default is 25000. | Optional | 
| update_context | Determines whether the results will be entered into the context. Possible values: "true" and "false". Possible values are: true, false. Default is true. | Optional |

| sid | The job sid. | Optional | 
| fast_mode | The Fast mode prioritizes the performance of the search and does not return nonessential field or event data. This means that the search returns what is essential and required if fast_mode equals 'true'. Possible values are: true, false. Default is false. | Optional |

## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and SplunkPy_copy corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in SplunkPy_copy events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in SplunkPy_copy events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and SplunkPy_copy events will be reflected in both directions. |

3. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding event is closed in SplunkPy_copy.

Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and SplunkPy_copy.
