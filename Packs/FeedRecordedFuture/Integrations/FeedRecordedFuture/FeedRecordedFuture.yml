    A comma-separated list of risk rules which limits the indicators list to a specific risk rule.
    For example: 'dhsAis,phishingUrl'.

    To see available risk rules run the rf-feed-get-risk-rules command.
    This parameter will only be used for the 'connectApi' service.
    Using the 'large' risk rule is not recommended.
