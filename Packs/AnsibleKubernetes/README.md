This pack enables you to integrate with Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

This integration enables the management of Kubernetes using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server. The Ansible modules have been exposed as XSOAR commands, and allow you to use them without needing to know Ansible.
