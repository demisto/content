## Pre-Process Rule

The integration pulls in Playbook alerts from Recorded Future base on its updates, this creates the need for a preprocessing rule that updates existing incidents instead of creating duplicates. Follow the guidlines below to configure the preprocessing rule.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Pre-Process Rules**
2. Click **New Rule**
3. Enter a name for the rule
4. In the Conditions for Incoming Incident section, enter the following:
**Name** - **Includes** - **Recorded Future Playbook Alert**
5. In the Action section, select: Drop and update
6. In the Update section, choose:
**Link to** - **Oldest incident** - **Created within the last** - *Your desired timeframe*
7. In the rule for update, choose:
**DbotMirrorId** - **Is identical (Incoming Incident)** - **to incoming incident**

![Pre-process Rule](../../doc_files/playbook_alerts_pre_process_rule.png)

> The configuration of the preprocessing rule is optional, but highly recommended.


## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
