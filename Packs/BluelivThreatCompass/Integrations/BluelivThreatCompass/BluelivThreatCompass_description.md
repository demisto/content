## Blueliv ThreatCompass
Some importants things to take into account about the integration:
- The _login user_ must be _dedicated_ to Demisto. In every call, Demisto will have to re-login into the platform and for every login, Blueliv will automatically log out any other sessi√≥n of the user. 
- There are three important parameters in the configuration of the integration:
    - **Organization ID** can be found in the GUI URL, it is the number after the key "organizations". For example: for https://demisto.blueliv.com/dashboard/organizations/8/indexed the Organization ID will be 8.
    - **Module ID** can be found in the GUI URL, it is the number after the key "modules". For example: for https://demisto.blueliv.com/dashboard/organizations/8/modules/59 the Module ID will be 59.
    - It is important that the value in **Module Type** matches the type of module referred by the Module ID. So if the module with ID 59 (see previous point) is Data Leaks the value of Module Type should be Data Leaks.
