#### Integrations

##### Blueliv ThreatCompass
- **Breaking changes:** *fetch-incidents* command will now return results by ascending order. If you have a pre-configured instance, pleas make sure to reset last run from the integration's configuration window after the pack update.
-   Fixed an issue where **Fetch incidents** failed due to usage of deprecated query params.
-   Updated the Docker image to: _demisto/python3:3.10.13.84405_.
