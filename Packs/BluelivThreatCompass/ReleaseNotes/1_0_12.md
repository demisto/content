#### Integrations

##### Blueliv ThreatCompass

-   Fixed an issue where **Fetch incidents** failed due to usage of deprecated query params.
-   Note: **Fetch incidents** will now return results in ascending order rather than descending.
-   Updated the Docker image to: _demisto/python3:3.10.13.84405_.
