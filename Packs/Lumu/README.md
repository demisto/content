_Creators of the Continuous Compromise Assessment™ model.
Our vision? To measure the world’s cyber-compromise by enabling any organization to continuously and intentionally measure and understand compromise to close the breach detection gap from months to minutes._

Cortex XSOAR interfaces with [LUMU](https://lumu.io/) to help streamline security-related service management and visibility from any of both sides. 

The data in Lumu Incidents can be mirrored to Cortex XSOAR so that you can track the status and information in the task. 
You can also provide comments, change of status like mute, unmute and close in XSOAR which will appear and reflect in Lumu Platform. 


# What does this pack do?

- Monitor and poll the Lumu Incident from Cortex XSOAR, using de [Lumu API specification](https://docs.lumu.io/portal/en/kb/articles/core-concepts-api#Consult_incidents_updates_through_REST) 
- Using Cortex mirroring  process updates the Lumu incidents retrieved from Lumu in Cortex XSOAR.
- Operate the incident from Cortex, launching action like muting, unmuting and closing incident from Cortex and submit through Lumu  API to sync the both platforms status.
- Manual interaction to operate Lumu incidents with commands, there are more than 15 commands to work automatically or manually

As part of this pack, you will also get 1 addicional out-of-the-box layout name `lumu` so that you can visualize Lumu incident information in Cortex XSOAR.
