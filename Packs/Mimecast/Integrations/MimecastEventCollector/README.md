## General information 
This integration is collecting events from 2 end points. 
* ### audit events
    All events are fetched at once when activating the integration from **first fetch timestamp** until now.
    After that the fetch mechanism will call every 1 minute to update the audit events from Mimecast.
* ### SIEM logs 
    The logs will **always be fetched from 7 days ago**. Once the integration is activated, the logs will 
    stream in batches of 350 logs per fetch.
    When all available logs are retrieved, the fetch mechanism will call every 1 minute to update the SIEM logs from Mimecast.
