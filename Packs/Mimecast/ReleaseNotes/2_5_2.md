##### Mimecast v2

- Fixed an issue where the **mimecast-query** command did not function correctly when both the *sentTo* and *sentFrom* arguments were provided simultaneously.
- Fixed an issue where the **mimecast-query** command failed when using the *subject* argument due to an incorrect search query.
