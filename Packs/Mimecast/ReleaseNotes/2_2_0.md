#### Integrations

##### Mimecast v2

- Added support for displaying specified fields in context and readable output when calling         **mimecast-query**. These fields are specified under <return-fields> and will now appear alongside the  default fields that were shown until now.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.12.68714*.
