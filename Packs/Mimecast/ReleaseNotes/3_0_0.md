#### Integrations

##### Mimecast Event Collector

- **Breaking Changes**: Migrated from the legacy API 1.0 authentication method to OAuth2 client credentials flow for Mimecast API 2.0.
  - Added support for new API 2.0 authentication via the ***Client ID*** and ***Client Secret*** parameters.
  - Dropped support for API 1.0 authentication and removed the ***Application ID***, ***Application Key***, ***Access Key***, and ***Secret Key*** parameters.

- **Breaking Changes**: Removed the ***First fetch timestamp*** parameter. New integration instances will begin fetching events from the last minute.

- Added support for the ***Fetch event types*** parameter that denotes the types of audit and SIEM events to fetch.

- Added support for the `siem_event_types`, `start_date`, and `end_date` arguments in the ***!mimecast-get-events*** command.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3-tools:1.0.0.6308650*.
