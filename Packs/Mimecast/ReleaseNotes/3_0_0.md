#### Integrations

##### Mimecast Event Collector

- **Breaking Change**: Updated the authentication method to support Mimecast API 2.0 following [the announcement about Mimecast API 1.0 End of Life](https://mimecastsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/39704312201235-API-Integrations-API-1-0-End-of-Life-Mar-2025).
  - Added support for the new OAuth2 client credentials flow using ***Client ID*** and ***Client Secret*** parameters.
  - Deprecated support for legacy API 1.0 authentication method and removed the ***Application ID***, ***Application Key***, ***Access Key***, and ***Secret Key*** parameters.

- **Breaking Change**: Migrated the SIEM logs endpoint to Mimecast API 2.0.
  - Restricted the ***First fetch timestamp*** parameter to audit events due to SIEM API 2.0 endpoint limitations.
  - **Note**: Upgrading the content pack version resets the SIEM pagination state. Users may temporarily experience event duplication or a gap in fetched events immediately after the version upgrade.
  - **Note**: The SIEM log event schema in the raw API response has been updated, requiring new field mapping.

- Added support for the ***Fetch event types*** parameter which specifies the types of events to fetch.

- Added support for the *event_types*, *start_date*, and *end_date* arguments in the ***mimecast-get-events*** command.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3-tools:1.0.0.6308650*.
