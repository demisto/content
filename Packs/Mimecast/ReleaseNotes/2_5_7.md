#### Integrations

##### Mimecast v2

- Fixed an issue where the ***fetch-incidents*** command only fetched 100 incidents in a fetch cycle. Set the Incidents Fetch Interval to a maximum of 15 minutes if the number of incidents is expected to exceed the specified max fetch limit in each fetch cycle.
- Added the *Max fetch limit* parameter. Default value is 100, maximum value is 200. This parameter allows to manually configure the maximum fetch limit for each incident type.
- **Breaking changes**: Make sure to set the Incidents Fetch Interval to a maximum of 15 minutes if the number of incidents is expected to exceed the specified max fetch limit in each fetch cycle.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.8.1983910*.
