#### Overview
The CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) integration with Cortex (XSOAR and XSIAM) enhances security operations by providing SOC teams with enriched context around security incidents related to identities. EPM helps organizations reduce the risk of endpoint attacks by removing local administrator rights and enforcing least privilege policies. It provides application control and privilege management to prevent malware and ransomware attacks, while enabling end-users to perform their tasks without interruption.

#### What does this pack do?
This new pack enables you with correlation rules for all detections fetched from EPM to XSIAM, mapping them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and generate alerts. Additionally, it provides EPM commands for XSOAR and XSIAM, allowing you to build integrations using these connectors. You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSIAM Alerts War Room as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
