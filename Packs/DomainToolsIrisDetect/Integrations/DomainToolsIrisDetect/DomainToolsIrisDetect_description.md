# DomainTools Iris Detect

DomainTools is an essential component in the security stack of mature enterprises and performance-driven security teams. Iris Detect helps organizations discover and monitor lookalike domains with unmatched speed and coverage.

The DomainTools Iris Detect content pack works indepenently or alongside the DomainTools Iris Content Pack. It works with the Iris Detect APIs to help you discover, track, and act against lookalike domains. A DomainTools key provisioned for Iris Detect is required.

Configure the pack to ingest and optionally create incidents off of new, watched, or escalated domains on a scheduled basis, as frequently as hourly. Indicator mappings and layouts help you act on the domains.
