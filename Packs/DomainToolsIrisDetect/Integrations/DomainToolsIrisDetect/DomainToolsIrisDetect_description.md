# DomainTools Iris Detect

#### Threat Actors Move Fast. Detect Helps You Move Faster.

Iris Detect is an Internet infrastructure detection, monitoring, and enforcement tool built on the industry’s fastest and broadest domain discovery engine and the largest databases of domain data. Capturing key data on new domains and risk-scoring them within minutes of discovery, Detect is a game-changer for brand managers, digital risk and fraud prevention teams, and network defenders.

#### Key Benefits

Rapid Discovery of Infringing Domains Continuous Monitoring of Evolving Infrastructure Enforcement Actions for Dangerous Domains

#### Fastest New Domain Discovery

Iris Detect employs the most sophisticated and extensive new-domain discovery capabilities, across all TLDs globally. Domains are enriched with preliminary Whois, DNS, and Risk Score data. The Iris Detect for Cortex XSOAR integration can create incidents as frequently as hourly,  incidents containing mapped indicators of newly-discovered domains matching the monitored keywords.

#### Watch Suspicious Domains for Changes

Through ad-hoc War-Room commands or on the incidents directly, domains of interest may be added to Iris Detect’s Watchlist, which triggers automatic daily updates, looking for hosting infrastructure or webpage changes. These changes can be consumed as their own incidents or sent to a separate workflow, giving you the ability to track evolving threat campaigns, classify, and identify which domains are most likely to do harm.

#### Enable Effective Enforcement

Merely knowing about malicious infrastructure is not enough. Iris Detect offers impactful enforcement options: Block flagged domains from incidents directly or using ad-hoc War-Room commands. Additionally, blocked domains can appear on their own feed, enabling you to take scripted enforcement actions in your security controls. Take action by sending domains to Google Phishing Protection, which can block them in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, among other browsers.
