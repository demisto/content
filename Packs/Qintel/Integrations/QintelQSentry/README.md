QSentry queries help measure the likelihood that a user is masking their identity using publicly or privately available proxy or VPN services.  The returns also flag any known fraud associations.  QSentry aggregates data from Qintelâ€™s proprietary Deep and DarkWeb research, as well as from commercially available anonymization services.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 4.0 of Qintel QSentry
