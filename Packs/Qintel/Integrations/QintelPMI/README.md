Qintelâ€™s Patch Management Intelligence (PMI) product simplifies the vulnerability management process by providing vital context around reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. With this integration, users can query PMI to surface CVEs that are known by Qintel to be leveraged by eCrime and Nation State adversaries.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 0.16.0 of PMI
