##### Sixgill DarkFeed Threat Intelligence
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/sixgill:1.0.0.56489*.

- We’re happy to announce the release (April 16th) of Darkfeed 2.0, which integrates the industry’s best open-source IOC feeds into our deep and dark web IOC collection, delivering 20X more IOCs with richer context, mapped to the Mitre ATT&CK framework and STIX/TAXII compatible.
