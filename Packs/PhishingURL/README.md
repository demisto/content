Phishing URLs are one of the most frequent, easily executable, and harmful security attacks that organizations – regardless of size – face today. High-volume, persistent phishing alerts are a time sink to manage, with incident response requiring coordination between multiple security products and communications with end users. 
This pack aims to detect URL phishing attacks automatically using machine learning techniques. The model ingests a large volume of infomation such as a screenshot of the webpage, HTML of the webpage, and WHOIS data, and returns an explainable verdict.
