## Outputs
---

| **Path** | **Description** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.URL | URL on which the model ran. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.FinalVerdict | Final verdict of the URL. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.UseOfSuspiciousLogo | Whether a logo \(from our list of top most use company for phishing\) has been fraudulently used. Our predefined list of logos is: Paypal, Instagram, Gmail, Outlook, Linkedin, Facebook, Ebay, amazon, Google, Microsoft. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.HasLoginForm | Whether there is a login form in the HTML. Usually phishing attacks aim to steal credentials from the victim and attackers using login forms to retrieve this information. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.URLStaticScore | Probability for the URL to be malicious based only on the URL syntax. | Number |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.BadSEOQuality | Whether the domain has a good search engine optimization. Malicious domains tend to have a poor SEO. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.NewDomain | Whether the domain is younger than 6 months. New domains tend to be malicious. | String |
| DBotPredictURLPhishing.TopMajesticDomain | Whether the domain belongs to the top Majestic domain list. If it does, we will always consider this domain as benign. | String |
| DBotScore.Score | Severity score. | Number |
