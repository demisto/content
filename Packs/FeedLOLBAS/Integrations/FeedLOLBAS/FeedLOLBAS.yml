description: 'Living off the land binaries" is a term used to describe malware or hacking techniques that take advantage of legitimate tools and processes that are already present on a computer or network, rather than introducing new malware or malicious code. The goal is to blend in with normal activity and avoid detection. Examples of this include using built-in Windows commands to move laterally through a network, or using scripting languages that are commonly installed on a system to execute malicious code. LOLBAS project is documenting binaries, scripts, and libraries that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.'
