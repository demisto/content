## Application Authorization Flow

* To allow Cortex XSOAR to access Gmail, you will need to create an OAuth2 App and approve the authorization flow. Please see the full documentation at: [the Integration Documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/gmail-single-user#application-authorization-flow).
* **Note**: the "Test" button is not supported for this integration. To verify that authentication was configured correctly, run the ***!gmail-auth-test*** command.
