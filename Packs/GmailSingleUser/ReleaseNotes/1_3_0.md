##### Gmail Single User
- New authorization flow using OAuth2 Web Application credentials.
- **Notice**: The OAuth2 Web Application authorization flow is replacing the previous OOB authorization flow. Due to deprecation by Google, the OOB authorization flow will stop working on Jan 31, 2023. Existing users must migrate their authorization setup by this date. Further documentation setup is available at: [Gmail Single User Integration Documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/gmail-single-user#application-authorization-flow).
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/google-api-py3:1.0.0.36366*.
