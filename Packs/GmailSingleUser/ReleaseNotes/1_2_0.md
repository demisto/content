#### Integrations
##### Gmail Single User (Beta)
- Added a new "Send as" parameter that can be used to specify a send as address. If the account has the e-mail alias
enabled for this address, it will send as this address instead of the "email" parameter. The "email" parameter is 
still used as the authenticating user-id.
