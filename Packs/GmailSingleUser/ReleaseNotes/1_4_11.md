#### Integrations

##### Gmail Single User

- Fixed an issue where emails that arrived up to one minute late were missed during fetch. The fetch process now accounts for slight delays and ensures such emails are included.

- Added new command **gmail-get-incidents** to support more robust incident retrieval from Gmail.

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/google-api-py3:1.0.0.2786860*.
