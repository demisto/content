## Configuring your Automox XSOAR Instance
In order for the XSOAR Automox Integration to authenticate with the Automox API, you'll need to get an API key from the Automox console. Here's how:
* Navigate to the [Automox console](https://console.automox.com/) and log in.
* Once you're logged in, navigate to the "Keys" page under "Settings".
* Here you can add a new key for XSOAR (recommended), or use an existing one.

For more information about managing keys, please read our [support article](https://support.automox.com/help/managing-keys) about it (with pictures!)
