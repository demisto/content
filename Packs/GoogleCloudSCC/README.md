1. __Vulnerability findings - Public bucket ACL:__ When a cloud storage bucket is detected as publicly accessible (that means that anyone can read/ edit the content of the bucket) the user will notified about this event and will get a recommendation on how to act regarding this issue. usually for this type of event, you will need to remove users from the bucket's members list

2. __Vulnerability findings - Open RDP Port:__ When a firewall configuration is set to have an open RDP port that allows connections from all IP addresses on TCP | UDP port 3389.
The recommendation will be to restrict firewall rules.
