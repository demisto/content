        The filter expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators AND and OR.
        Parentheses are supported, and OR has higher precedence than AND.Examples include:

        2) securityCenterProperties.resource_name
        3) resourceProperties.name
        4) securityMarks.marks.marka

        The supported operators are:
        1) = for all value types.
        2) >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
        3) :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
