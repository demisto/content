        The filter expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators AND and OR.
        Parentheses are supported, and OR has higher precedence than AND.Examples include:
        1) name
        2) securityCenterProperties.resource_name
        3) resourceProperties.name
        4) securityMarks.marks.marka

        The supported operators are:
        1) = for all value types.
        2) >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
        3) :, meaning substring matching, for strings.

        The following field and operator combinations are supported:
        1) name: =
        2) updateTime: =, >, <, >=, <

        Example: resourceProperties.displayName="test.com" OR resourceProperties.projectNumber="455757558851"
        Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: "-resourceProperties.project=45".
