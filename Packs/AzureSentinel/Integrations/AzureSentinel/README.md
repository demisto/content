Use the Azure Sentinel integration to get and manage incidents and get related entity information for incidents.
This integration was integrated and tested with API version ***2019-01-01-preview*** of Azure Sentinel.

> <i>Note:</i> The integration is in ***beta*** as it uses a preview version of the Azure Sentniel API. The stable Azure Sentniel API version does not contain all  required endpoints used in some of the integration commands.

## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Sentinel

You need to grant Cortex XSOAR authorization to access Azure Sentinel.

1. Access the [authorization flow](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-azure-sentinel). 
2. Click the **Start Authorization Process** button and you will be prompted to grant Cortex XSOAR permissions for your Azure Service Management. 
3. Click the **Accept** button and you will receive your ID, token, and key. You will need to enter these when you configure the Azure Sentinel integration instance in Cortex XSOAR.

## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Sentinel (self-deployed configuration)

Follow these steps for a self-deployed configuration.

1. To use a self-configured Azure application, you need to add a new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal. To add the registration, refer to the following [Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).
2. Make sure the following permissions are granted for the app registration:
   -  API/Permission name `user_impersonation` of type `Delegated`
3. Copy the following URL and replace the ***CLIENT_ID*** and ***REDIRECT_URI*** with your own client ID and redirect URI, accordingly.
```https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&resource=https://management.core.windows.net&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI```
4. Enter the link and you will be prompted to grant Cortex XSOAR permissions for your Azure Service Management. You will be automatically redirected to a link with the following structure:
```REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTH_CODE&session_state=SESSION_STATE```
5. Copy the ***AUTH_CODE*** (without the “code=” prefix) and paste it in your instance configuration under the **Authorization code** parameter. 
6. Enter your client ID in the ***ID*** parameter. 
7. Enter your client secret in the ***Key*** parameter.
8. Enter your tenant ID in the ***Token*** parameter.
9. Enter your redirect URI in the ***Redirect URI*** parameter.

## Get the additional instance parameters

To get the ***Subscription ID***, ***Workspace Name*** and ***Resource Group*** parameters, navigate in the Azure Portal to ***Azure Sentinel > YOUR-WORKSPACE > Settings*** and click on ***Workspace Settings*** tab.


## Configure Azure Sentinel on Demisto

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Azure Sentinel.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auth_id | ID (received from the authorization step - see Detailed Instructions (?) section) | True |
| refresh_token | Token (received from the authorization step - see Detailed Instructions (?) section) | True |
| enc_key | Key (received from the authorization step - see Detailed Instructions (?) section) | True |
| self_deployed | Use a self-deployed Azure application | False |
| redirect_uri | Application redirect URI (for self-deployed mode) | False |
| auth_code | Authorization code (received from the authorization step - see Detailed Instructions (?) section) | False |
| isFetch | Fetch incidents | False |
| fetch_time | First fetch timestamp ({number} {time unit}, e.g., 12 hours, 7 days) | False |
| min_severity | The minimum severity of incidents to fetch | False |
| incidentType | Incident type | False |
| subscriptionID | Subscription ID | True |
| resourceGroupName | Resource Group Name | True |
| workspaceName | Workspace Name | True |
| insecure | Trust any certificate (not secure) | False |
| proxy | Use system proxy settings | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Demisto CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
