First of all, we are looping all the open XSOAR incidents based on two incident types:
"IoT Alert" and "IoT Vulnerability"

Then we are only interested of the ones with a customized instance field: ServiceNow table name, that tells us a
corresponding ServiceNow ticket was created. Looping each one of this incident, and query ServiceNow for the ticket
