| Script Type | python3 |

| Demisto Version | 5.5.0 |

This script is using the device and incident attributes to evaluate the Responsible (R) and Informed (I) parties in the RACI model.

A list variable needs to be created with a fixed format JSON. You can create a new XSOAR list variable under Settings > Advanced > Lists.

By default, the name of the list variable is IOT_CONFIG.

There are three main sections in the JSON: devices, alerts, and groups.

"devices" is a list of devices mapping to the owners based on the device_id, which is a concatenation of the device's category, profile, vendor and model delimited by "|".
 - device_id: a regular expression to match
 - owner: a group name, which is also defined in the "groups" section

"alerts" is a list of conditions to map a combination of IoT incident type and incident names to the RACI model.
 - iot_raw_type: either "IoT Alert" or "IoT Vulnerability"
 - name_regex: a list of regular expressions trying to match with the alert/vulnerability names
 - raci: a section to define the RACI model for the match. If the value is "IOT_OWNER", we look up the underlying group using the mapping in "devices" section.

"groups" is all the groups found in the "devices" and "alerts" section.
 - email: the email of the group, this is used when setting the incident owner in XSOAR or sending an email through the email integration
 - snow: it has three fields, table, fields and custom_fields. Those are the fields when you use the official ServiceNow integration when you create a ServiceNow ticket.

Here is the template of the JSON:
