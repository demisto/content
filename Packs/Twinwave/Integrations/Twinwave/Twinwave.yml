        Throughout the analysis of a Resource, a variety of Artifacts may be generated. These include things like Screenshots, PCAPs, HAR files, etc. This API endpoint generates a temporary URL that can be used to download the contents of an artifact.

        After making a call to this endpoint, the URL field will contain a link to a signed URL for the desired Artifact. This link has a limited lifetime, so upon receiving it, you should immediately make a GET request to retrieve the actual Artifact.
