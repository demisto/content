description: TwinWaveâ€™s threat analysis platform analyzes both URLs and files to detect credential phishing and malware threats. Our platform automatically navigates complex attack chains that attackers put in front of threats in order to evade analysis. In addition to detecting threats, the TwinWave platform generates actionable intelligence for threat hunting and other activities.

        Throughout the analysis of a Resource, a variety of Artifacts may be generated. These include things like Screenshots, PCAPs, HAR files, etc. This API endpoint generates a temporary URL that can be used to download the contents of an artifact.

        After making a call to this endpoint, the URL field will contain a link to a signed URL for the desired Artifact. This link has a limited lifetime, so upon receiving it, you should immediately make a GET request to retrieve the actual Artifact.
