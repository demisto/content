#### Why Penfield
Penfield is the industryâ€™s first human-machine intelligence platform to model Cybersecurity Analysts actions and processes in real-time. Penfield automatically assigns incidents within the SOC to the appropriate Analyst, to improve the overall speed and accuracy of the incident resolution process. In order to interpret the decision making process, Penfield ingests incident data from XSOAR and combines it with Analyst Interaction data, such as; processes and skills, paired with real-time factors such as active memory, experience, and queue, based on a command and script, Penfield provides XSOAR with the name of the Analyst best suited to respond to the incident, and which in turn automates the assignment.
