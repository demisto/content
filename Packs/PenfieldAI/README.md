Penfield automatically assigns incidents within the SOC to the appropriate Analyst, to improve the overall speed and accuracy of the incident resolution process. In order to interpret the decision making process, Penfield ingests incident data from XSOAR and combines it with Analyst Interaction data, such as; processes and skills, paired with real-time factors such as active memory, experience, and queue. Based on a command and script, XSOAR is then able to provide the name of the Analyst best suited to respond to the incident.
