#### Integrations

##### PANOS-HA

- Fixed: device_priority parameter now correctly applied as object property instead of constructor parameter
- Fixed: Resolved ValueError "No param device_priority exists" error from pan-os-python library
- Enhanced: Added error handling for device_priority configuration with fallback
- Enhanced: Device priority is only set when value differs from default (100)

#### Bug Fix Details

**Issue:** Version 1.1.2 attempted to pass `device_priority` to the `HighAvailability()` constructor, but the pan-os-python library doesn't accept it as a constructor parameter.

**Error:**
```
ValueError: No param "device_priority" exists
```

**Solution:** Set `device_priority` as an object property after creating the `HighAvailability` object:

```python
ha_config = HighAvailability(...)
ha_config.device_priority = 150  # Set as property
```

**Behavior:**
- Device priority is now set correctly on the HighAvailability object
- Only applied when value is not None and differs from default (100)
- Includes error handling with warning log if setting fails
- Maintains backward compatibility with v1.1.1

**Testing:**
- Verified with PA2 using `device_priority="150"`
- Confirmed proper HA election with priority-based active device selection
