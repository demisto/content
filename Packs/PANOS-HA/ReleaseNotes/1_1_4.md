##### PANOS-HA

- Fixed: panos-ha-get-config now correctly displays device_priority value
- Fixed: panos-ha-get-config now correctly displays heartbeat_backup value
- Fixed: Election settings XML parsing now searches within group element instead of root

#### Bug Fix Details

**Issue:** The `panos-ha-get-config` command was showing:
- Device Priority: **N/A** (incorrect)
- Heartbeat Backup: **No** (incorrect)

Even though the firewall XML contained the correct values:
```xml
<group>
  <election-option>
    <device-priority>150</device-priority>
    <heartbeat-backup>yes</heartbeat-backup>
  </election-option>
</group>
```

**Root Cause:** The code was searching for election settings from the root `ha_config` element:
```python
find_text(ha_config, 'election-option/device-priority')  # ❌ Wrong parent
```

But the election-option is nested inside the `group` element in the XML structure.

**Solution:** Changed to search from the `group` element:
```python
find_text(group, 'election-option/device-priority')  # ✅ Correct parent
```

**Testing:**
Run `!panos-ha-get-config using="pa3"` and verify the Election Settings table now shows:
- Device Priority: **150** (was N/A)
- Heartbeat Backup: **Yes** (was No)

**Note:** This is a display-only fix. The device_priority and heartbeat_backup were being **configured correctly** on the firewall (v1.1.3 works), but the get-config command wasn't **reading them back** correctly.
