#### Troubleshooting Guide

The enhanced debug logging provides detailed visibility into the HA configuration process. To view logs in XSOAR:

1. Navigate to Settings -> About -> Troubleshooting
2. Enable "Server Log" debug level
3. Run the panos-ha-configure command
4. Check server logs for detailed output

**Example Debug Output:**

```
================================================================================
PANOS-HA: Starting HA configuration process
================================================================================
Target device: 10.135.10.65
Received parameters: group_id=10, peer_ip=192.168.26.101, peer_ip_backup=192.168.26.105, ha1_port=ha1-a, ha1_ip_address=192.168.26.102, ...

--- Phase 1: Validating HA interfaces before configuration ---
Validating 4 interface(s): ['ha1-a', 'ha1-b', 'ethernet1/11', 'ethernet1/12']
✅ All interfaces validated successfully. Proceeding with HA configuration.

--- Phase 2: Building HighAvailability object from arguments ---
Creating HighAvailability object:
  - enabled=True
  - group_id=10
  - peer_ip=192.168.26.101
  - peer_ip_backup=192.168.26.105
  - mode=active-passive
  - passive_link_state=auto
  - config_sync=True
✅ HighAvailability base object created successfully.

Configuring HA1 (Primary Control Link):
  - port=ha1-a
  - ip_address=192.168.26.102
  - netmask=255.255.255.252
  - gateway=Not configured
✅ HA1 object created and added successfully.

Configuring HA1-Backup (Backup Control Link):
  - port=ha1-b
  - ip_address=192.168.26.106
  - netmask=255.255.255.252
✅ HA1-Backup object created and added successfully.

Configuring HA2 (Primary Data Link):
  - port=ethernet1/11
  - ip_address=192.168.26.110
  - netmask=255.255.255.252
✅ HA2 object created and added successfully.

Configuring HA2-Backup (Backup Data Link):
  - port=ethernet1/12
  - ip_address=192.168.26.114
  - netmask=255.255.255.252
✅ HA2-Backup object created and added successfully.

--- Phase 3: Applying HA configuration object to the device ---
Adding HA configuration object to client's object tree...
✅ HA configuration object added to client.
Applying configuration to candidate config...
✅ Configuration successfully written to candidate config.

--- Phase 4: Commit phase skipped (commit=false) ---
⚠️  Configuration is in candidate mode. Manual commit required.

================================================================================
PANOS-HA: Configuration process completed successfully

**Error Example (if HA1Backup class doesn't exist):**

```
Configuring HA1-Backup (Backup Control Link):
  - port=ha1-b
  - ip_address=192.168.26.106
  - netmask=255.255.255.252
❌ Failed to create HA1-Backup object: name 'HA1Backup' is not defined
Error type: NameError
Error details: name 'HA1Backup' is not defined
```

This logging enables precise identification of which component failed and why, making troubleshooting significantly faster.
