This pack enables you to manage Cisco IOS switches and routers using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server. The Ansible modules have been exposed as XSOAR commands, and allow you to use them without needing to know Ansible.
