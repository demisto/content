This integration enables the management of Cisco IOS Switches and Routers directly from XSOAR using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server, all you need to do is provide credentials you are ready to use the feature rich commands. This integration functions without any agents or additional software installed on the hosts by utilising SSH.

To use this integration, configure an instance of this integration. This will associate a credential to be used to access hosts when commands are run. The commands from this integration will take the IOS host address(es) as an input, and use the saved credential associated to the instance to execute. Create separate instances if multiple credentials are required.

## Credentials
This integration supports a number of methods of authenticating with the network device:

1. Username & Password entered into the integration
2. Username & Password credential from the XSOAR credential manager
3. Username and SSH Key from the XSOAR credential manager

In addition to the SSH credential, a `enable` password must be also provided.
## Permissions
The user account used for initial SSH login access can be level 1, however the enable password must also be provided.
## Network Requirements
By default, TCP port 22 will be used to initiate a SSH connection to the IOS host.

The connection will be initiated from the XSOAR engine/server specified in the instance settings.
## Configure Ansible Cisco IOS on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Ansible Cisco IOS.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Username | The credentials to associate with the instance. SSH keys can be configured using the credential manager. | True |
    | Password |  | True |
    | Enable Password |  | True |
    | Default SSH Port | The default port to use if one is not specified in the commands \`host\` argument. | True |
    | Concurrency Factor | If multiple hosts are specified in a command, how many hosts should be interacted with concurrently. | True |

## Testing
This integration does not support testing from the integration management screen. Instead it is recommended to use the `!ios-facts`command providing an example `host` as the command argument. This command will connect to the specified network device with the configured credentials in the integration, and if successful output general information about the device.

## Idempotence
The action commands in this integration are idempotent. This means that the result of performing it once is exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any intervening actions.

## State Arguement
Some of the commands in this integration take a state argument. These define the desired end state of the object being managed. As a result these commands are able to perform multiple management operations depending on the desired state value. Common state values are:
| **State** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| present | Object should exist. If not present, the object will be created with the provided parameters. If present but not with correct parameters, it will be modified to met provided parameters. |
| running | Object should be running not stopped. |
| stopped | Object should be stopped not running. |
| restarted | Object will be restarted. |
| absent | Object should not exist. If it it exists it will be deleted. |

## Complex Command Inputs
Some commands may require structured input arguments such as `lists` or `dictionary`, these can be provided in standard JSON notation wrapped in double curly braces. For example a argument called `dns_servers` that accepts a list of server IPs 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 would be entered as `dns_servers="{{ ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'] }}"`.

Other more advanced data manipulation tools such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html)/[Jinja2 filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#builtin-filters) can also be used in-line. For example to get a [random number](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#random-number-filter) between 0 and 60 you can use `{{ 60 | random }}`.
## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### ios-command
***
Run commands on remote devices running Cisco IOS
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/ios_command_module.html


#### Base Command

`ios-command`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| commands | List of commands to send to the remote ios device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the `wait_for` argument is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device requires answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing `command`, `answer` and `prompt`. Common answers are 'y' or "\r" (carriage return, must be double quotes). See examples. | Required | 
| wait_for | List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples. | Optional | 
| match | The `match` argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for` argument to specify the match policy.  Valid values are `all` or `any`.  If the value is set to `all` then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If the value is set to `any` then only one of the values must be satisfied. Possible values are: any, all. Default is all. | Optional | 
| retries | Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for` conditions. Default is 10. | Optional | 
| interval | Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how long to wait before trying the command again. Default is 1. | Optional |

### ios-config
***
Manage Cisco IOS configuration sections
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/ios_config_module.html


#### Base Command

`ios-config`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| lines | The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section.  The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config.  Be sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser. | Optional | 
| parents | The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy the commands should be checked against.  If the parents argument is omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands. | Optional | 
| src | Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load.  The path to the source file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory.  This argument is mutually exclusive with `lines`, `parents`. | Optional | 
| before | The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made.  This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system. | Optional | 
| after | The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made.  Just like with `before` this allows the playbook designer to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set. | Optional | 
| match | Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config.  If match is set to `line`, commands are matched line by line.  If match is set to `strict`, command lines are matched with respect to position.  If match is set to `exact`, command lines must be an equal match.  Finally, if match is set to `none`, the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device. Possible values are: line, strict, exact, none. Default is line. | Optional | 
| replace | Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device. If the replace argument is set to `line` then the modified lines are pushed to the device in configuration mode.  If the replace argument is set to `block` then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not correct. Possible values are: line, block. Default is line. | Optional | 
| multiline_delimiter | This argument is used when pushing a multiline configuration element to the IOS device.  It specifies the character to use as the delimiting character.  This only applies to the configuration action. Default is @. | Optional | 
| backup | This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current `running-config` from the remote device before any changes are made. If the `backup_options` value is not given, the backup file is written to the `backup` folder in the playbook root directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created. Default is no. | Optional | 
| running_config | The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of source. There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook.  The `running_config` argument allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison. | Optional | 
| defaults | This argument specifies whether or not to collect all defaults when getting the remote device running config.  When enabled, the module will get the current config by issuing the command `show running-config all`. Default is no. | Optional | 
| save_when | When changes are made to the device running-configuration, the changes are not copied to non-volatile storage by default.  Using this argument will change that before.  If the argument is set to `always`, then the running-config will always be copied to the startup-config and the `modified` flag will always be set to True.  If the argument is set to `modified`, then the running-config will only be copied to the startup-config if it has changed since the last save to startup-config.  If the argument is set to `never`, the running-config will never be copied to the startup-config.  If the argument is set to `changed`, then the running-config will only be copied to the startup-config if the task has made a change. `changed` was added in Ansible 2.5. Possible values are: always, never, modified, changed. Default is never. | Optional | 
| diff_against | When using the `ansible-playbook --diff` command line argument the module can generate diffs against different sources. When this option is configure as `startup`, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the startup-config. When this option is configured as `intended`, the module will return the diff of the running-config against the configuration provided in the `intended_config` argument. When this option is configured as `running`, the module will return the before and after diff of the running-config with respect to any changes made to the device configuration. Possible values are: running, startup, intended. | Optional | 
| diff_ignore_lines | Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be ignored during the diff.  This is used for lines in the configuration that are automatically updated by the system.  This argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line matches. | Optional | 
| intended_config | The `intended_config` provides the master configuration that the node should conform to and is used to check the final running-config against. This argument will not modify any settings on the remote device and is strictly used to check the compliance of the current device's configuration against.  When specifying this argument, the task should also modify the `diff_against` value and set it to `intended`. | Optional | 
| backup_options | This is a dict object containing configurable options related to backup file path. The value of this option is read only when `backup` is set to `yes`, if `backup` is set to `no` this option will be silently ignored. | Optional |

***
Collect facts from remote devices running Cisco IOS
Further documentation available at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/ios_facts_module.html


#### Base Command

`ios-facts`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| gather_subset | When supplied, this argument restricts the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include `all`, `min`, `hardware`, `config`, and `interfaces`. Specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Use a value with an initial `!` to collect all facts except that subset. Default is !config. | Optional | 
| gather_network_resources | When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include all and the resources like interfaces, vlans etc. Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset. Values can also be used with an initial `M(!`) to specify that a specific subset should not be collected. Valid subsets are 'all', 'interfaces', 'l2_interfaces', 'vlans', 'lag_interfaces', 'lacp', 'lacp_interfaces', 'lldp_global', 'lldp_interfaces', 'l3_interfaces'. | Optional |

| host | hostname or IP of target. Optionally the port can be specified using :PORT. If multiple targets are specified using an array, the integration will use the configured concurrency factor for high performance. | Required | 
| vrfs | The set of VRF definition objects to be configured on the remote IOS device.  Ths list entries can either be the VRF name or a hash of VRF definitions and attributes.  This argument is mutually exclusive with the `name` argument. | Optional | 
| name | The name of the VRF definition to be managed on the remote IOS device.  The VRF definition name is an ASCII string name used to uniquely identify the VRF.  This argument is mutually exclusive with the `vrfs` argument. | Optional | 
| description | Provides a short description of the VRF definition in the current active configuration.  The VRF definition value accepts alphanumeric characters used to provide additional information about the VRF. | Optional | 
| rd | The router-distinguisher value uniquely identifies the VRF to routing processes on the remote IOS system.  The RD value takes the form of `A:B` where `A` and `B` are both numeric values. | Optional | 
| interfaces | Identifies the set of interfaces that should be configured in the VRF.  Interfaces must be routed interfaces in order to be placed into a VRF. | Optional | 
| associated_interfaces | This is a intent option and checks the operational state of the for given vrf `name` for associated interfaces. If the value in the `associated_interfaces` does not match with the operational state of vrf interfaces on device it will result in failure. | Optional | 
| delay | Time in seconds to wait before checking for the operational state on remote device. Default is 10. | Optional | 
| purge | Instructs the module to consider the VRF definition absolute.  It will remove any previously configured VRFs on the device. Possible values are: Yes, No. Default is No. | Optional | 
| state | Configures the state of the VRF definition as it relates to the device operational configuration.  When set to `present`, the VRF should be configured in the device active configuration and when set to `absent` the VRF should not be in the device active configuration. Possible values are: present, absent. Default is present. | Optional | 
| route_both | Adds an export and import list of extended route target communities to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_export | Adds an export list of extended route target communities to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_import | Adds an import list of extended route target communities to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_both_ipv4 | Adds an export and import list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_export_ipv4 | Adds an export list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_import_ipv4 | Adds an import list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_both_ipv6 | Adds an export and import list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_export_ipv6 | Adds an export list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 
| route_import_ipv6 | Adds an import list of extended route target communities in address-family configuration submode to the VRF. | Optional | 


#### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CiscoIOS.IosVrf.commands | unknown | The list of configuration mode commands to send to the device | 
| CiscoIOS.IosVrf.start | string | The time the job started | 
| CiscoIOS.IosVrf.end | string | The time the job ended | 
| CiscoIOS.IosVrf.delta | string | The time elapsed to perform all operations | 


### Troubleshooting
The Ansible-Runner container is not suitable for running as a non-root user.
Therefore, the Ansible integrations will fail if you follow the instructions in the Cortex XSOAR [Docker Hardening Guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Docker-Hardening-Guide). 

The `docker.run.internal.asuser` server configuration causes the software that is run inside of the Docker containers utilized by Cortex XSOAR to run as a non-root user account inside the container.

The Ansible-Runner software is required to run as root as it applies its own isolation via bwrap to the Ansible execution environment. 

This is a limitation of the Ansible-Runner software itself https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/611.

A workaround is to use the `docker.run.internal.asuser.ignore` server setting and to configure Cortex XSOAR to ignore the Ansible container image by setting the value of `demisto/ansible-runner` and afterwards running /reset_containers to reload any containers that might be running to ensure they receive the configuration.

See step 2 of this [guide](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.10/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Run-Docker-with-Non-Root-Internal-Users) for complete instructions.
