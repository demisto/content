The Cortex XSOAR marketplace provides some of the best use-cases that we can imagine, that will suit any organization out there, but every organization is unique, it has its own protocols, processes and needs.

This pack provides the ability to control your Cortex XSOAR system, your use-cases, and your unique configurations all in one place. 

##### What does this pack do?
* Sets up an Cortex XSOAR machine automatically using a predefined configuration file.
* Lets you control your own developed Cortex XSOAR content, using third party version control systems and artifacts servers.
* Organizes the information you need to know on the installation process in a designated incident type.

As part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident type, fields and layout, and a playbook for managing the entire configuration process.
