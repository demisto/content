This integration transfers files between Cortex XSOAR and a remote machine and executes commands on the remote machine.

Some changes have been made that might affect your existing content. 
If you are upgrading from a previous version of this integration, see [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes-from-the-previous-version-of-this-integration---remoteaccess-v2).

**Note:** This integration was integrated and tested on a remote machine with Centos-7 operating system. It does not work with Windows operation system.

## Configure RemoteAccess v2 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for RemoteAccess v2.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Default Hostname or IP Address | If not provided, "host" or "system" should be provided in the command's arguments. | False |
    | User | For example, "root". | False |
    | Password | The password of the remote machine. | False |
    | sshKey | The private RSA key to authenticate to the remote machine, should be configured within the credentials object. | False
    | Additional Password | Requires an additional password as an argument to run any command of this module. | False |
    | Ciphers | A comma-separated list of ciphers to use. If none of the specified ciphers are agreed to by the server, an error message specifying the supported ciphers is returned. | False |
    | Key Algorithms | A comma-separated list of key algorithms to use. If none of the specified key algorithms are agreed to by the server, an error message specifying the supported key algorithms is returned. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Configure SSH From Remote
For login using root:
1. Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
- set `PermitRootLogin` to `yes`
- set `PasswordAuthentication` to `yes`
2. Restart the sshd server: `service sshd restart`

## Configure the instance with SSH certificate
Currently, the only type of certificate that is supported is RSA private keys (.PEM) files.
In case access is required to an instance in the cloud, use the PEM file provided by the cloud provider.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
