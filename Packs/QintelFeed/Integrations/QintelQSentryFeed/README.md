This feed of IPs are associated with infrastructure actively utilized or abused by cyber criminals, including VPN/Proxy services and malicious hosts. With this integration, users can fetch a daily list of newly compiled indicators from QSentryâ€™s proprietary collections to quickly surface suspicious activity.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 3.x of QSentry Feeds

## Configure QintelQSentryFeed on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for QintelQSentryFeed.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | QSentry API URL (optional) |  | False |
    | Qintel Token |  | True |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Fetch indicators |  | False |
    | Feed Types | Select which feed types to ingest | False |
    | Override Indicator Reputation | Indicators from this integration instance will be marked with this reputation regardless of feed classification. Criminal indicators will be scored one level higher. | False |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | True |
    |  |  | False |
    |  |  | False |
    | Feed Fetch Interval |  | False |
    | Bypass exclusion list | When selected, the exclusion list is ignored for indicators from this feed. This means that if an indicator from this feed is on the exclusion list, the indicator might still be added to the system. | False |
    | Traffic Light Protocol Color | The Traffic Light Protocol \(TLP\) designation to apply to indicators fetched from the feed | False |
    | Incremental feed | Incremental feeds pull only new or modified indicators that have been sent from the integration. The determination if the indicator is new or modified happens on the 3rd-party vendor's side, so only indicators that are new or modified are sent to Cortex XSOAR. Therefore, all indicators coming from these feeds are labeled new or modified. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
