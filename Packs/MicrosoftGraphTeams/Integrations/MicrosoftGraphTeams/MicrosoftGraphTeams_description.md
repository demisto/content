Microsoft integrations (Graph and Azure) in Cortex XSOAR use Azure Active Directory applications to authenticate with Microsoft APIs. These integrations use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication services, which use an Application to sign-in or delegate authentication. For more information, see the Microsoft identity platform overview.

# Self-Deployed Application
To use a [Self-Deployed Application](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#self-deployed-application)
, you need to add a [new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#register-a-new-application-using-the-azure-portal).

### Authentication Using the User - Authorization Code Flow

Follow these steps for [Authorization Code flow](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication#authorize-on-behalf-of-a-user) configuration:

To add the registration, refer to the following [Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-create-app-web?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-app) steps 1-8.
