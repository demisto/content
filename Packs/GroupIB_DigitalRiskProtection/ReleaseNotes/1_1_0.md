#### Integrations

##### Group-IB Digital Risk Protection

- Updated the Group-IB Digital Risk Protection integration:
  - Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/vendors-sdk:1.0.0.6383083*.
  - Logging: added structured debug prefixes and contextual fields across Client and IncidentBuilder.
  - Fetch progress: preserved last_fetch when no new seqUpdate is returned; advance only when a larger seqUpdate is observed to avoid unintended resets.


#### Scripts

##### GIBDRPIncidentUpdate

- Updated the GIBDRPIncidentUpdate script:
  - Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.12.12.6796194*.
  - Reliable duplicate prevention: robust gibdrpid extraction (CustomFields/top-level/rawJSON/dbotMirrorId), exact-match search (including closed incidents), and in-place updates of existing incidents with detailed debug logging.
