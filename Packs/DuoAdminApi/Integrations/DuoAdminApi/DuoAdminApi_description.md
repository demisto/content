DUO admin api provides programmatic access to the administrative functionality of Duo Security's two-factor authentication platform.

To set up an instance you will need:
API hostname: admin api hostname provided by duo (e.g. api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com)
Integration key: your integration key provided by duo
Secret key: your secret key/password provided by duo

Notice that duo admin api requires different credentials from your regular duo account (i.e. another set of api hostname, integration key and secret key)
