#### Integrations
##### Gmail
- Added the ***reply-mail*** command which sends an email reply to a given message using Gmail.
- Fixed the following issues in the ***send-mail*** command:
  - The *additionalHeader* argument was added to the request only if attachments were received.
  - Attachments were not attached correctly when both the *htmlBody* and *body* arguments were received.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/google-api:1.0.0.13775*.
