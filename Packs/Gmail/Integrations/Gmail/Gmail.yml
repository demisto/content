      Creates a custom "from" send-as alias. If an SMTP MSA is specified, Gmail will attempt to connect to the SMTP service to validate the configuration before creating the alias. If ownership verification is required for the alias, a message will be sent to the email address and the resource's verification status will be set to pending; otherwise, the resource will be created with verification status set to accepted. If a signature is provided, Gmail will sanitize the HTML before saving it with the alias.

      This command is only available to service account clients who have been delegated domain-wide authority.
