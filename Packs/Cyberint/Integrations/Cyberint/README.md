In case the accounts were involved in any fraudulent activity, it is recommended to identify and extract relevant IOC\u2019s where possible and monitor them within the bank's systems.\n3. To reduce the chance of customer account takeovers by TAs, Cyberint recommends Chase implement MFA and CAPTCHA mechanisms. The former will help set another obstacle for a TA trying to abuse the account, and the latter can help blocking credentials-stuffing tools.",
