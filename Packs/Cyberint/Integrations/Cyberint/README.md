The researcher, who goes by the nickname \"Sprachlos\", is well acclaimed on the website and has helped patch over 60 uvlnerabilities.\nThe researcher's profile is https://www.openbugbounty.org/researchers/Sprachlos/ and their email address is goktug__kaya@outlook.com.\n\nAccording to OBB's standards, the researcher may publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability on December 11, 2020.\n\nXSS attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user\u2019s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.",

It was also mentioned that the public disclosure of the vulnerability\u2019s details is scheduled for January 7, 2021.\n\nXSS refers to client-side code injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious scripts into a legitimate website. By leveraging XSS, an attacker would exploit a vulnerability within a website that the victim would visit, essentially using the vulnerable website as a vehicle to deliver a malicious script to the victim\u2019s browser.\n\nFor an XSS attack to take place, the vulnerable website needs to directly include user input in its pages.
