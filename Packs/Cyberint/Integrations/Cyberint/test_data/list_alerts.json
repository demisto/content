In addition, CyberInt advises Barclays to investigate internally whether any of the accounts have been involved in fraudulent transactions, at least up to the time of detection. In case the accounts were involved in any fraudulent activity, it is recommended to identify and extract relevant IOC’s where possible and monitor them within the bank's systems.\n3. To reduce the chance of customer account takeovers by TAs, Cyberint recommends Barclays implement MFA and CAPTCHA mechanisms. The former will help set another obstacle for a TA trying to abuse the account, and the latter can help blocking credentials-stuffing tools.",
