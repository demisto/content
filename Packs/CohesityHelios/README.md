Cohesity’s comprehensive, end-to-end solution [Cohesity Ransomware](https://www.cohesity.com/solutions/ransomware/) features a multi-layered approach to protect backup data against ransomware, detect, and rapidly recover from an attack. Cohesity’s unique [immutable architecture](https://www.cohesity.com/blogs/how-backup-immutability-defends-against-ransomware-attacks/) ensures that your backup data cannot be encrypted, modified or deleted. Using machine learning, it provides visibility and continuously monitors for any anomalies in your data. And if the worst happens, Cohesity helps to locate a clean copy of data across your global footprint, including public clouds, to instantly recover and reduce downtime.
