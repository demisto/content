## Authenticate via an Access Token
The ThreatExchange APIs perform authentication via access tokens.
After Facebook notifies you that your App can access ThreatExchange, use [the access token tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken) to get an App Token.
Please note, app tokens give access to sensitive details to your app and should be treated like a password.
For more information see [the ThreatExchange API Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/api/v10.0)

For Cortex XSOAR versions 6.0 and below, the App Secret should be set in the ***password*** field.
