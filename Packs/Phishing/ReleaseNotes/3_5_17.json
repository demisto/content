{"breakingChanges":true,"breakingChangesNotes":"The playbook `Process Email - Generic v2` will no longer set the `Email Body HTML` and `Rendered HTML` fields by default. There changes are aimed at reducing duplication of data and improving performance. Adjustments were made in OOTB playbooks. However, if you've built custom content that depends on those incident fields by the `Process Email - Generic v2` playbook, we recommend changing that content to use the `Email HTML` field instead."}
