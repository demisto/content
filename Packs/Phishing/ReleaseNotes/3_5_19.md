#### Layouts

##### Phishing Incident v3

Changed the Email Body section to use a dynamic section that will display the rendered HTML or the text of the email.

#### Playbooks

##### Process Email - Generic v2

Added an input called "UseOldHTMLFields". The new input determines whether the playbook will set the "Email Body HTML" and "Rendered HTML" fields with the HTML contents of the email. Setting the value to True will keep the old behavior of the playbook. Setting the value to False will cause the playbook to save less information to incident fields which can help if you are experiencing issues with large incidents. Note: If you decide to set the value to False, you may break functionality if your custom playbooks expect those fields to have data in them. The out-of-the-box playbooks will work either way.
