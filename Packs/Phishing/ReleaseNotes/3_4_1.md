#### Playbooks
##### Phishing - Generic v3
- Added the *SendMailInstance* playbook input. The name of the instance to be used when executing the ***send-mail*** command in the playbook. In case it will be empty, all available instances will be used (default).
- Added the *OriginalAuthenticationHeader* playbook input. This input will be used as the *original_authentication_header* argument in the **CheckEmailAuthenticity** script under the **Authenticate email** task. The header that holds the original Authentication-Results header value. This can be used when an intermediate server changes the original email and holds the original header value in a different header. Note - Use this only if you trust the server creating this header.
- Changed the severity check in the **Is the email malicious?** task to be *Malicious*. This means that the playbook would go to the *Malicious* path only if there is a malicious indicator and not suspicious or malicious as it was.
