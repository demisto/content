#### Playbooks
##### Process Email - Generic v2
Fixed an issue where the **Process Email - Generic v2** playbook stopped on an error when an attached eml contained more than one attachment.

#### Layouts
##### Phishing Incident v3
Removed the description for the "Email Attachments" section. This section now shows, in addition to the reported email attachments, the .eml or.msg of the reported email for both "Retrieved" and "Attached" scenarios.
