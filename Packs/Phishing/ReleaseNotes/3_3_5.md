##### Phishing - Generic v3
- Fixed an issue where a rerun of the playbook would send an email to the reported email address instead of the reporter email address. It is not recommended to rerun this playbook inside a phishing incident since it can produce
  an unexpected result. Create a new incident instead if needed.
