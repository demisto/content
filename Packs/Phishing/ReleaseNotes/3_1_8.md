##### Phishing - Generic v3
- Removed the **ReporterAddress** key usage. Instead, **Reporter Email Address** incident field is used where needed.
- Updated various tasks to use fields which represent a better value. For example, use **Reported Email From** and **Reported Email Subject** fields instead of **Email From** and **Email Subject** fields in the **Search And Delete Emails - Generic v2** task under the **O365KQL** input.
- Removed tasks where the **extractIndicators** script was used in order to extract the email address. Instead, the new **ExtractEmailTransformer** transformer is used.
- Updated the **Search And Delete Emails - Generic v2** sub playbook task to use the correct value for the **O365ExchangeLocation** input.
