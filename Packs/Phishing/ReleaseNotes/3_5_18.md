#### Layouts

##### Phishing Incident v3

- Changed the Email Body section to use a dynamic section that will display the rendered HTML or the text of the email.

#### Playbooks

##### Process Email - Generic v2

- Added an input called "UseOldHTMLFields". The new input determines whether the playbook will set the "Email Body HTML" and "Rendered HTML" fields with the HTML contents of the email. We recommend setting the value for that input to "False" unless you are exclusively using the Email Body HTML and Rendered HTML fields in your playbooks, and cannot replace those usages with the other fields - "Email HTML" or "Email Body".
