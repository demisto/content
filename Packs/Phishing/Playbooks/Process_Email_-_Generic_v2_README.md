Add email details to the relevant context entities and handle the case where original emails are attached.

Added on this v2 playbook:
- Uses incident fields and not incident labels.
- Provides separate paths to "Phishing Alerts".
- Uses the new "Get Original Email - Generic v2" playbook to retrieve original emails as eml files for both EWS v2 and Microsoft Graph Mail integration. This will assist with parsing the email artifacts in a more efficient way.
