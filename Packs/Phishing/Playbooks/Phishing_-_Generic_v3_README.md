This playbook investigates and remediates a potential phishing incident. It engages with the user who triggered the incident while investigating the incident itself.
The playbook is also able to detect phishing campaigns. In order to use that functionality, install the Phishing Campaign content pack, and configure the Demisto Lock integration.

Note: 
- Final remediation tasks are always decided by a human analyst. 
- Do not rerun this playbook inside a phishing incident since it can produce an unexpected result. Create a new incident instead if needed.

| DBotPredictURLPhishingURLsNumber | The number of URLs to extract from the email HTML and analyze in the "DBotPredictURLPhishing" automation.<br/>This automation runs several checks to determine the score of the URLs found in the email, sets a verdict for URLs found as "Suspicious" or "Malicious", and adds these URLs as indicators. Based on the verdict, the incident severity is set \(Medium for "Suspicious" and High for "Malicious"\).<br/>Note:<br/>- You need to install the "Phishing URL" pack to use this automation.<br/>- False/True positives are possible.<br/>- This automation may take a few minutes to run.<br/>- To increase result accuracy, it is recommended to install and enable the "Whois" pack \(optional\).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 3 | Optional |
| EmailFileToExtract | Reported emails and emails retrieved during playbook execution can contain multiple nested email files. For example, an EML nested inside another EML file.<br/>If multiple level files are detected, this field determines which file represents the phishing email.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>User1 receives an email from Attacker. User1 attaches the email as an EML file and sends the email to User2.<br/>User2 also attaches that email as a file, and reports it as phishing. In this case, the phishing email would be the "inner file" \(as opposed to "outer file"\).<br/><br/>Possible values are: Inner file, Outer file, All files.<br/>Inner file: The file at the deepest level is parsed. If there is only one file, that file is parsed.<br/>Outer file: The file at the first level is parsed.<br/>All files: All files are parsed. Do not use this option in the phishing playbook, as there should only be one phishing email per playbook run. | Inner file | Optional |
| HuntEmailIndicators | Whether to enter the "Email Indicators Hunting" branch in the playbook. Under this branch, sub-playbooks would be triggered in order to hunt malicious indicators found in other emails and optionally, automatically create new incidents for each found email \(configurable through next playbook inputs\).
