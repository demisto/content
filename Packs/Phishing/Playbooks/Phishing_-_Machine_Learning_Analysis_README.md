## Playbook Inputs
---

| **Name** | **Description** | **Default Value** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ExtractedURLsFromFiles | The list of URLs that were extracted from the file. This output is a duplicate of the URL.Data output and it enables parent playbooks to identify the URLs generated by this playbook. |  | Optional |
| PhishingModelName | Optional - the name of a pre-trained phishing model to predict phishing type using machine learning. |  | Optional |
| DBotPredictURLPhishingURLsNumber | The number of URLs to extract from the email HTML and analyze in the "DBotPredictURLPhishing" automation.<br/>This automation runs several checks to determine the score of the URLs found in the email, sets a verdict for URLs found as "Suspicious" or "Malicious", and adds these URLs as indicators. Based on the verdict, the incident severity is set \(Medium for "Suspicious" and High for "Malicious"\).<br/>Note:<br/>- You need to install the "Phishing URL" pack to use this automation.<br/>- False/True positives are possible.<br/>- This automation may take a few minutes to run.<br/>- To increase result accuracy, it is recommended to install and enable the "Whois" pack \(optional\). |  | Optional |
