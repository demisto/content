##### What can this pack do?
- Dissect emails, providing screenshots of the email and of embedded URLs, and calculating reputation for all indicators involved.
- Extracts and enriches all indicators from email attachments. Analyze files and provide reputation using sandbox and threat intelligence integrations.
- Run checks for SSL certificates of URLs, email address breach involvement, domain-squatting and email authenticity (using SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks).
- Calculate severity for the incident based on initial severity provided, indicator reputations, email authenticity check, and critical assets if any were involved.
- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators, searching and deleting malicious emails and allowing an analyst to manually take remediation steps. All potentially harmful actions require analyst approval.
- Engage with the user throughout the investigation - updating them when their email is received and starts to be investigated, and whether it is found to be malicious or benign.
