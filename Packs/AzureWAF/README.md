# Azure Web Application Firewall 


<~XSOAR> [Azure WAF Integration](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/azure-waf) </~XSOAR>

## Overview

Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is designed to actively shield your web applications from common web exploits and vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. 

It operates as an application-level firewall, focusing on web application traffic. 

Azure WAF integrates with Azure services like Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, and Azure CDN.

## Data Collection

To configure Microsoft Azure WAF to send logs to Cortex XSIAM, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

- Create an **Azure event hub**. For more information, refer to Microsoft's official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).
- Make sure that you have at least a Security Administrator role.
- For Azure WAF Front Door event logs you will need to [Create an Azure Front Door profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/create-front-door-portal?tabs=quick)

### Stream logs to an event hub

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Entra admin center**.
2. Navigate to **Identity** &rarr; **Monitoring & health** &rarr; **Diagnostic settings**.
    - To stream Front Door logs, select the relevant Front Door profile 
    - Within the profile, navigate to **Monitoring**, and select **Diagnostic Setting**.
3. Select **+ Add diagnostic setting** to create a new integration or select **Edit setting** for an existing integration.
4. Enter a **Diagnostic setting name**. If you're editing an existing integration, you can't change the name.
5. Select the log categories that you want to stream. Refer to the **Log Normalization** section for the supported log categories for normalization.
6. Select the **Stream to an event hub** checkbox.
7. Select the Azure subscription, Event Hubs namespace, and optional event hub where you want to route the logs.

For more information, refer to Microsoft's official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-stream-logs-to-event-hub).

### Cortex XSIAM side

To connect Cortex XSIAM to the Azure Event Hub, follow the below steps.

#### Azure Event Hub Collector

1. Navigate to **Settings** &rarr; **Data Sources**.
2. If you have already configured an **Azure Event Hub Collector**, select the **3 dots**, and then select **+ Add New Instance**. If not, select **+ Add Data Source**, search for "Azure Event Hub" and then select **Connect**.
3. Fill in the attributes based on the Azure Event Hub you streamed your data to.
4. Leave the **Use audit logs in analytics** checkbox selected, unless you were told otherwise.
