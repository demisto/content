This playbook is used to set up shift handover meetings with all the accompanying processes such as creating an online meeting, creating a notification in a integrated chat app (for example Slack), creating a SOC manager briefing, and creating a display of the active incidents, team members who are on-call, and team members who are out of the office.
By modifying the playbook inputs you can decide whether to activate the Assign Active Incidents to Next Shift and whether a user who is out of the office will be taken into consideration.
