#### Playbooks
##### New: Set up a Shift handover meeting
- This playbook is used to create an online meeting for shift handover. Currently, this playbook supports Zoom. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
##### New: Assign Active Incidents to Next Shift V2
- This playbook reassigns Active Incidents to the current users on call. It requires shift management to be set up.  The playbook can be run as a job a few minutes after the scheduled shift change time.

You can update the playbook input with a different search query, if required.  Will branch if there are no incidents that match the query and no users on call. 

Cases will not be assigned to users that defined OOO (by OutOfOffice automation). (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).

#### Scripts
##### GetUsersOOO
Fixed an issue when the OOO List is empty.
