### gcp-compute-firewall-patch

***
Updates the specified firewall rule with the data included in the request.

#### Base Command

`gcp-compute-firewall-patch`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| project_id | GCP project ID. | Required | 
| resource_name | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. | Required | 
| description | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. | Optional | 
| network | URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used. | Optional | 
| priority | Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority. | Optional | 
| sourceRanges | If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported. comma separated. . | Optional | 
| destinationRanges | If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported. comma separated. | Optional | 
| sourceTags | If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. comma separated. | Optional | 
| targetTags | A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. comma separated. | Optional | 
| sourceServiceAccounts | If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. comma separated. | Optional | 
| targetServiceAccounts | A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. comma separated. | Optional | 
| allowed | The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted connection. Ex: ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80. | Optional | 
| denied | The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection. Ex: ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80. | Optional | 
| direction | Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags. | Optional | 
| logConfigEnable | This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. Possible values are: true, false. | Optional | 
| disabled | Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled. Possible values are: true, false. | Optional |
