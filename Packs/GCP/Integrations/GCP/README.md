### gcp-compute-firewall-patch

***
Updates the specified firewall rule with the data included in the request.

#### Base Command

`gcp-compute-firewall-patch`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| project_id | GCP project ID. | Required |
| resource_name | Name of the firewall rule to update. | Required |
| description | An optional description of this resource, which you provide when you create the resource. | Optional |
| network | URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used. | Optional |
| priority | Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules. | Optional |
| sourceRanges | If source ranges are specified, the firewall applies only to traffic with source IP addresses in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall applies to traffic with a source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belonging to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported, comma-separated. | Optional |
| destinationRanges | If destination ranges are specified, the firewall applies only to traffic with destination IP addresses in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported. Comma-separated. | Optional |
| sourceTags | If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address. It only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network, because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic with a source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belonging to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Comma-separated. | Optional |
| targetTags | A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. Comma-separated. | Optional |
| sourceServiceAccounts | If source service accounts are specified, the firewall applies only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with a service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used simultaneously as sourceTags or targetTags. Comma-separated. | Optional |
| targetServiceAccounts | A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. Comma-separated. | Optional |
| allowed | The ALLOW rules list specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted connection. For example, ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80. | Optional |
| denied | The DENY rules list specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection. For example, ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80. | Optional |
| direction | Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags. | Optional |
| logConfigEnable | This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. Possible values are: true, false. | Optional |
| disabled | Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled. Possible values are: true, false. | Optional |

| GCP.Compute.Operations.targetLink | string | The URL of the resource that the operation modifies. For operations related to creating a snapshot, this points to the persistent disk from which the snapshot was created. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.targetId | string | The unique target ID, which identifies a specific incarnation of the target resource. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.status | string | The status of the operation, which can be one of the following: PENDING RUNNING or DONE. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.statusMessage | string | An optional textual description of the current status of the operation. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.user | string | The user who requested the operation, for example, EMAILADDRESS. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.progress | number | An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.insertTime | string | The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.startTime | string | The time that this operation was started by the server. This value is in RFC3339 text format. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.endTime | string | The time that this operation was completed. This value is in RFC3339 text format. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.error | string | If errors are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.warnings | string | If warning messages are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.httpErrorStatusCode | number | If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a 404 means the resource was not found. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.httpErrorMessage | string | If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as NOT FOUND. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.selfLink | string | Server-defined URL for the resource. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.region | string | The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only available when performing regional operations. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not configurable as a field in the request body. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.description | string | A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created. |
| GCP.Compute.Operations.kind | string | Type of the resource. Always compute\#operation for Operation resources. |
