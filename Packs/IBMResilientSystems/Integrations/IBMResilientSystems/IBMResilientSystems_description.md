**Connection & authentication**


In order to retrieve an API key from the IBM Resilient Systems web UI, go to: _Administrator Settings_ -> _Users tab_ -> _API Keys_ -> **_Create API Key_**.

Capture the generated _API Key ID_ and _API Key Secret_, and provide it to the integration instance configuration.

**Notice**: credentials authentication (username & password) is deprecated and should no longer be used. 

___________
**Mirroring**

Default classifiers & mappers are provided for incoming and outgoing incidents.

It's important to configure the desired mirroring direction and pick whether to close mirrored incidents on both sides for an improved experience.
