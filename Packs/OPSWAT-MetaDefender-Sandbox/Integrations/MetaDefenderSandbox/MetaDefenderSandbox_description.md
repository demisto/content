## Prerequisites

For the integration you need your MetaDefender Sandbox API key.

You can use the Activation Key that you received from your OPSWAT Sales Representative, and follow the instructions on the [OPSWAT Licence Activation](https://docs.opswat.com/filescan/installation/license-activation) page or you can create an API key on the [Community Site](https://www.filescan.io/users/profile?active=apikeyinfo) under API Key tab.
