#### Playbooks
##### New: Checkpoint - Block IP - Append Group
This playbook uses an object group to block IPs.
The playbook receives malicious IP addresses as inputs, checks if the object group exists (if not, the object group is created), and  appends the related IPs to that object. 
If you have not assigned the appended group to a rule in your firewall policy, you can use `rule_name` and the playbook creates a new rule.
