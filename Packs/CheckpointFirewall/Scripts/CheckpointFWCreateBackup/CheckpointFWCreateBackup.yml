comment: Connect to a checkpoint firewall appliance using SSH and trigger a task to
  create a configuration backup of the device. The user account being used to access
  the device must be set to use the SSH shell and not the built in Checkpoint CLI.
  Consult the Checkpoint documentation for instructions on how to do this.
