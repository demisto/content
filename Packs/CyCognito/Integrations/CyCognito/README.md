The CyCognito integration fetches issues discovered by the CyCognito platform, thereby providing users with a view of their organization's internet-exposed attack surface. These issues include identification, prioritization, and recommendations for remediation of the risks faced by the organization. The integration contains commands to query assets and issues detected by the CyCognito platform, and includes a rich dashboard and layout with issue management capability.
This integration was integrated and tested with CyCognito V1 API.
