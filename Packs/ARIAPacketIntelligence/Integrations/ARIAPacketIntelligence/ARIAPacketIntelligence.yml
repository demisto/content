description: The ARIA Cybesecurity Solutions Software-Defined Security (SDS)  platform
  integrates with Cortex XSOAR to add robustness when responding to incidents. The
  combination of ARIA hardware, in the form of a Secure Intelligent Adapter (SIA),
  and software, specifically Packet Intelligence and SDS orchestrator (SDSo), provides
  the elements required to react instantly when an incident is detected. When integrated
  with the ARIA solution, you can create playbooks that instruct one or more SIAs
  to add, modify, or delete rules automatically. These rule changes, which take effect
  immediately, can block conversations, redirect packets to a recorder or VLAN, or
  perform a variety of other actions.
