To configure the integration, enter your credentials in the following fields:

## Known Limitations
Clicking the **Test** button of the **Integration instance settings** window verifies that the instance configuration is correct.
Due to a known limitation, clicking the **Test** button several times in quick succession may result in an "Unauthorized" error, even after a successful result was initially returned. It is enough to receive one success message to verify that the configuration is correct. "Unauthorized" error messages received from repeated clicking of the instance configuration **Test** button do not affect the validity of the instance if the initial response was successful.
