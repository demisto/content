# CheckPointNDR

To set up a CheckPointNDR instance, please provide Infinity NDR API URL based on your portal's region and credentials.
If you have several portals in different regions, you will need to use an instance per region.

* Contact [Infinity NDR team](ndr@checkpoint.com) to get your client id and access key
* Keep your credentials secret since they give access to your data in Check Point Systems
