AWS WAF is a web application firewall service that lets you monitor web requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, an Amazon CloudFront distribution, or an Application Load Balancer. 
You can protect those resources based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that the requests originate from.
