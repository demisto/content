Important:
Before using the ACCOUNT_ENABLE_MFA and ACCOUNT_RESET_PASSWORD actions on "trendmicro-cas-user-take-action" , run a PowerShell script to assign the Company Administrator role to Cloud App Security. For details, [see Assigning the User Account Administrator Role](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/cloud-app-security-online-help/administration/user-and-role/role-management.aspx).

In the fetch incidents field, each service and event type must be marked separately.

You can test this with the test button in the instance setting.
