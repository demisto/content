##### New: Trend Micro CAS - Indicators Hunting
Created a new playbook for threat hunting and detection of IOCs within email messages protected by **Trend Micro Cloud App Security** utilizing the ***trendmicro-cas-email-sweep*** command. Supported IOCs for this playbook are: IP addresses, CIDR, file names, file types, SHA1 hashes, URLs, domains, and email addresses. Separate searches are conducted for each type of indicator in the playbook.
<!--\n\nNote that multiple search values should be separated by commas only (without spaces or any special characters).-->
