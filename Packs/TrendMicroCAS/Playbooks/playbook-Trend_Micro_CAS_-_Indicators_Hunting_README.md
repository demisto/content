| start | The start date and time from which you would like to retrieve messages from TrendMicro CAS. <br/>Use ISO 8601 time format, e.g. 2020-08-01T02:31:20Z, or 'human-readable' data, such as 1 day ago or 3 weeks ago.<br/><br/>For a complete time range, specify 'end' as well.<br/>If 'start' is not specified messages will be retrieved from TrendMicro CAS within seven days before the end time. In the absence of 'start' and 'end' inputs, the default value is 'last seven days' is set.<br/><br/>Do not configure 'lastndays' and 'start' or 'end' at the same time. |  | Optional |
| end | The end date and time specify the period of time in which messages should be retrieved from TrendMicro CAS. <br/>Use ISO 8601 time format, e.g. 2020-08-01T02:31:20Z, or 'human-readable' data, such as 1 day ago or 3 weeks ago.<br/><br/>For a complete time range, specify 'start' as well.<br/>If 'end' is not specified messages will be retrieved from TrendMicro CAS within seven days after the start time.
