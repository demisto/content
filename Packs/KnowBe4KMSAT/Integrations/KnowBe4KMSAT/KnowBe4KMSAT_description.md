## KnowBe4's KMSAT Console API

Integrate KnowBe4's KMSAT console with Palo Alto Networks' XSOAR platform for threat intelligence based on KMSAT phishing security tests and security awareness training. Then, you can act on risk, automate remediation, and more in your XSOAR platform.

### Generate API Keys

For this integration, you'll need a Reporting API key and User Event API key from your KMSAT console. You can generate these API keys from your KMSAT Account Settings. For more information, see KnowBe4's [Reporting API](https://developer.knowbe4.com/rest/reporting#tag/Authentication) and [User Event API](https://developer.knowbe4.com/rest/userEvents#tag/Authentication) documentation.
