## Important Updates for Version 8.5.5 and Later
Forcepoint's API calls to delete URLs/IPs from a category and to delete the category itself have changed. See [Forcepoint's documentation](https://help.forcepoint.com/websec/en-us/on-prem/85/mgmt_api_guide/1E0FA6F7-FDD2-41DE-B3A7-9CDE6B2D348E.html).

Check the Version 8.5.5 or later flag to switch to use these newer api endpoints.
