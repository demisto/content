#### Modeling Rules

##### AWSGuardDuty Modeling Rule

- Fixed an issue where field extractions and mappings failed due to case-sensitivity.
  - Added support for *camelCase* naming convention fields in addition to the existing *PascalCase* naming convention.
  - Added support for cases where the dataset's underlying schema is set with *camelCase* field names while the ingested finding records are in *PascalCase*. 

#### Parsing Rules

##### AWSGuardDuty Parsing Rule

- Fixed an issue where the **UpdatedAt** field was received in *camelCase* - **updatedAt**, and thus was not parsed correctly to **_time**.
