Arcanna.ai can triage alerts so you can focus on investigation!

Alert triage is one of the biggest problems in todayâ€™s IT & Cybersecurity due to the sheer number of sensors, devices and applications that need to be monitored and continuously generate alerts.


Arcanna uses data, machine learning, and automation to unlock greater human potential by helping them focus on innovation rather than false alarms

Arcanna.ai is designed and built to enhance teams of experts with AI, enabling them to extract insights and automate processes that would otherwise consume much of their valuable time or not even possible

## Configure Arcanna.AI  on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Arcanna.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.


### check_arcanna_status
checks if Arcanna configured endpoint is valid and configured api_key is valid.
##### Output
Writes in WarRoom status

### get_default_job_id
Retrieves Arcanna Default Job id
Default job id is useful when you have one arcanna job and you want to send all that incident data only to that particular job

##### Output
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arcanna_default_job_id | Number | Default Job Id | 

### set_default_job_id
Sets Arcanna Default Job id

##### Input
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** | **Mandatory** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| job_id | Number | Job Id to be set as default | yes |

##### Output
Writes in WarRoom status

### get_event_status
Retrieves Arcanna AI inference result based on the job_id and event_id.
Retrieving inference result is an async operation (in most cases)

##### Input
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** | **Mandatory** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| job_id | Number | Job Id  | yes |
| event_id | Number | Unique Id generated by Arcanna at send_event  | yes |


##### Output
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arcanna_jobs[].error_message | String | specifies the type of Arcanna ML processor used  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].confidence_level | Number | Arcanna ML confidende score  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].status | String | specifies inference status of the Arcanna processing of event .Ex [Inference Pending/Error/Ok]  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].event_id | String | Unique id generated by Arcanna.Ex 112341515161616121  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].ingest_timestamp | String | Ingest timestamp  generated by Arcanna  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].result | String | Arcanna decision for current event.Ex [drop_alert/escale_alert]  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].is_duplicated | Boolean | Arcanna can detect if the event is a duplicate | 

### get_jobs
Retrieves all available Arcanna jobs as a tableMarkdown
Can be used for discriminating jobs based on input type

##### Output
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arcanna_jobs[].data_type | String | specifies the type of Arcanna ML processor used  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].job_id | Number | specifies Arcanna Job internal job_id.Ex 1001  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].status | String | specifies status of the Arcanna Job.Ex [Started/Idle/Stopped]  | 
### send_event
Sends an event to Arcanna to run inference based on the resutl 


##### Input
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** | **Mandatory** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| job_id | Number | Job Id  | yes |
| event_json | String | Json string of the raw event| yes |
| severity | Number | Incident severity| yes |
| title | String | Incident title| yes |


##### Output
| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arcanna_jobs[].error_message | String | specifies the type of Arcanna ML processor used  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].status | String | specifies inference status of the Arcanna processing of event .Ex [Inference Pending/Error/Ok]  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].event_id | String | Unique id generated by Arcanna.Ex 112341515161616121  | 
| arcanna_jobs[].ingest_timestamp | String | Ingest timestamp  generated by Arcanna  |
