Playbook takes incident data and sends it to Arcanna.Ai for ML inference and automated decision. Once decision is retrieved, manual input ( in this case )
from analyst is added in as feedback and sent back to Arcanna.ai. Once Feedback is provided in the final steps of the playbook, an automated AI Training
is triggered and finally the full record, that contains all Arcanna.ai added metadata, is retrieved back into the context
