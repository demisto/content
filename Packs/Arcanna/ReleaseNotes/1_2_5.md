#### Integrations

##### Arcanna.AI

* Improved context outputs with more structured and consistent naming (`Arcanna.SendEventDetails`, `Arcanna.GetEventDetails`, etc.).
* Added Polling support (`polling`, `interval`, `timeout`) in `arcanna-get-event-status` for automated retrieval of inference results.
* Updated status values to reflect current Arcanna API (`pending_inference`, `ENABLED`, etc.).
* Enhanced human-readable outputs across commands for better War Room visualization.

##### Breaking Changes

* `job_id` is now **required** for `arcanna-send-event` (was optional before).
* Context paths have been refactored for consistency (e.g., `Arcanna.Event` → `Arcanna.SendEventDetails`, `Arcanna.GetEventDetails`, etc.).
* Feedback command (`arcanna-send-event-feedback`) no longer requires `decision_set`.

#### Playbooks

##### Arcanna-Generic-Investigation
* Deprecated. Use Arcanna-Playbook instead.

##### Arcanna-Playbook
* This sub-playbook automates event analysis and feedback exchange with Arcanna in XSOAR — preparing event data, sending it for AI analysis, retrieving results, and optionally collecting and submitting analyst feedback. The 'Get Arcanna Response' step also maps information for layouts and dashboards (see task 'Mapping' tab).

#### Incident Fields  

Added new Arcanna incident fields to enhance visibility in layouts and dashboards:  

* Arcanna bucket state  
* Arcanna decision  
* Arcanna decision confidence score  
* Arcanna error message  
* Arcanna Event ID  
* Arcanna Feedback  
* Arcanna Feedback User  
* Arcanna job ID  
* Arcanna outlier flag  

### Bug Fixes

* Corrected context formatting for `arcanna-get-decision-set`.
* Improved error handling and status reporting in multiple commands.
