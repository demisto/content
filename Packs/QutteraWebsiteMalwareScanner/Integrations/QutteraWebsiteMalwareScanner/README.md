Quttera API inspects URLs, domains or websites for security issues.
Such as active malware, suspicious content, redirects, suspicious behaviour,
defacement, phishing, blocklisting, and other potential or actual security problems.

## What does this pack do?
This pack includes one integration:

- Quttera Website Malware Scanner integration:
    Interact with Quttera Website Malware Scanner API
    to perform real-time/on-demand recursive scan of a domain or URL,
    retrieve malware scan report and blocklisting information.

This pack also includes one playbook (TBD):

- Detonate URL - Quttera Website Malware Scanner. 
    Detonate one or more domains/URLs/hostnames using the Quttera Website Malware Scanner integration.
    This playbook returns intelligence reports, including IoC, to the War Room and URL/domain/hostname
    reputations/malware scan results/blocklisting status to the context data.
    Use the sensitivity parameter to control the sensitivity level of the scan (heuristic vs normal).
    Note: A polling mechanism is implemented since the scan takes time to run.

To report the false-positive or false-negative detection and to get general support: support@quttera.com.
