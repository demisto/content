description: 'This is a simple web-server that as of now, supports handling configurable user responses (like Yes/No/Maybe) and data collection tasks that can be used to fetch key value pairs. What makes it different from Data collection tasks is that, the URL to perform a certain action is predictable and written to the incident context when an action is setup.This URL can be inserted to for eg: an HTML email.  User clicks are  are recorded in the integration context and can be polled by Scheduled Commands/ Generic Polling.'
