This is a multipurpose playbook used for hunting and threat detection. The playbook receives inputs based on hashes, IP addresses, or domain names provided manually or from outputs by other playbooks. 
The playbook leverages data received by PANW products including, Strata Logging Service, Autofocus and Pan-OS to search for IP addresses, host names and users related to the provided indicators.
The output provided by the playbook enables you to find possibly affected IP addresses, users, and endpoints.

## Playbook Inputs

---

| **Name** | **Description** | **Default Value** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SHA256 | SHA256 hash of the indicator to hunt. |  | Optional |
| MD5 | MD5 hash of the indicator to hunt. |  | Optional |
| SHA1 | SHA1 hash of the indicator to hunt. |  | Optional |
| IPAddresses | List of IP addresses. |  | Optional |
| URLDomain | List of domains or urls. |  | Optional |
| InternalRange | A list of internal IP ranges to check IP addresses against. The list should be provided in CIDR notation, separated by commas. An example of a list of ranges would be: "172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16" \(without quotes\). |  | Optional |
| InternalDomainName | The organization's internal domain name. This is provided for the script IsInternalHostName that checks if the detected host names are internal or external if the hosts contain the internal domains suffix. For example demisto.com. If there is more than one domain, use the \| character to separate values such as \(demisto.com\|test.com\) |  | Optional |
| InternalHostRegex | This is provided for the script IsInternalHostName that checks if the detected host names are internal or external. Checks if the hosts match the organization's naming convention. For example the host testpc1 will have the following regex \\w\{6\}\\d\{1\} |  | Optional |
