This playbook is triggered by a Palo Alto Networks Cortex threat alert, generated by Traps.  The playbook performs host enrichment for the source host with Palo Alto Networks Traps, enriches information for the suspicious file with Palo Alto Networks Minemeld and AutoFocus, and automatically performs file detonation for the extracted file. It then performs IOC enrichment with Minemeld for all related IOCs, and calculates the incident severity based on all the findings. In addition we detonate the file for the full analysis report. 
The analyst can perform a manual memory dump for the suspected endpoint based on the incidentâ€™s severity, and choose to isolate the source endpoint with Traps.
Hunting tasks to find more endpoints that are infected is performed automatically based on a playbook input, and after all infected endpoints are found, remediation for all malicious IOCs is performed, including file quarantine, and IP and URLs blocking with Palo Alto Networks FireWall components such as Dynamic Address Groups and Custom URL Categories.
After the investigation review the incident is automatically closed.
