##### AWSRemediateSG

Added the script **AWSRemediateSG**, which duplicates Security Groups with rules modified to remove public exposure of a specified port. The updated list of security groups can be used to remediate public exposure of an AWS resource by replacing the current list.

##### AWSIdentifySGPublicExposure

Added the script **AWSIdentifySGPublicExposure** to determine which interface on an EC2 instance has a given public IP and identify associated security groups.
