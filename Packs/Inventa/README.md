**Inventa™**, AI-based sustainable data discovery and classification platform, provides automated, 
near real-time discovery, mapping, and tracking of all sensitive data at the enterprise scale. 
The platform assumes a zero-trust approach to data discovery and does not rely on input from 
organizational players.

With Inventa’s Supervised AI solution, the platform easily creates and maintains a Customer 
Master Catalog for Privacy, Security, and Data Governance use-cases. Additionally, with the 
help of Business Intelligence (BI) tools, enterprises can now discover customer uses of their 
services and offer new value-added services. Besides, users can now easily define new data 
lineage between different elements and maintain an up-to-date inventory for the enterprise 
as Inventa’s Master Catalog.

Integration included in this pack along with the playbook designed to automate discovery of 
the Data Subject storage details utilizes **Inventa's DSAR Engine**, allowing to keep nearly real-time 
track on what categories of information related to a certain Data Subject are stored in various data 
storages such as files, databases etc by simply creating relevant iDSAR (Inventa's DSAR) Incident.
