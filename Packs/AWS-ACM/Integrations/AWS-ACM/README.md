Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager Service (ACM)

For more information regarding the AWS ACM service, please visit the official documentation found [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/acm.html).

For detailed instructions about setting up authentication, see: [AWS Integrations - Authentication](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/aws-integrations---authentication).

## Configure AWS - ACM on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for AWS - ACM.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
