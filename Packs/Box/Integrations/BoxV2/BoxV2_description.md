## Differences between Box \(Deprecated\) and Box v2
- Context outputs were changed to be nested under the entity type for each command. For example, user outputs
used to be stored under the context root, Box. In this version they are stored under the entity Box.Users.
- Authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\) and no longer requires each command to retrieve an authentication
token manually.
- All results given via the Box API is returned into the context.
