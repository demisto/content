# Box Event Collector

Collect events from Box's logs.

## Permissions

The command is using the [events endpoint](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-events/) with enterprise login.
The user making the API call will need to have admin privileges, and the application will need to have the scope manage enterprise properties checked.

## Configure Box Event Collector on Cortex XSOAR

You can use the guide from [Box V2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/box-v2#configure-the-box-application-to-interface-with-xsoar) to get those credentials.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Box Event Collector.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | The maximum amount of events to fetch at once. 500 is maximum | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
