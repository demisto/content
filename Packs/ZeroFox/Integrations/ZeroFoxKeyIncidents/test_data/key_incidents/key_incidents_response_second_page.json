            "analysis": "On May 24, 2012, a government-funded Tourism Agency's small-group demonstration tours have begun with foreign tourists arriving in the country for the first time in about two years. The first group was seven travelers from a foreign nation. The seven participants, together with tour guides from a local travel agency, will spend approximately one-week touring popular tourist destinations in certain regions to confirm effective ways to ensure that people from overseas perform basic health measures such as temperature checks, disinfection, and the use of masks. This program will fully begin on June 10 and will be limited to escorted tours for foreign visitors. Conditions for participation include three doses of the vaccine, wearing masks in most public areas, and following the guidelines of the travel agency's tour plan. The Tourism Agency will continue to interview participants to determine areas for improvement and provide information to accommodation facilities and travel agencies.",

The coup was led by a military general who is the de-facto leader of the country. The leader is lifting the order to help international negotiations with the opposition who have been protesting non-stop since the coup. Most of the opposition has been boycotting the talks and the prospect of a political breakthrough is unlikely. Before the coup, the country was reopening to the international community and many international firms were re-opening offices after decades. However, the coup has suspended most of those relationships.",

Military personnel from one country have reportedly been captured by rebels in the other country, while one nation has suspended flights from the other over alleged support for rebel groups. In recent days, rebels have advanced to within 20 miles of a major city, displacing 100,000 people, before retreating. One country has been accused of supporting rebels operating in the neighboring territory for years. Recently, rebels were declared a terrorist group and have been precluded from peace talks being held in a neutral location between the government and other rebel groups. There are numerous rebel groups operating in the mineral rich regions, with many allegedly supported by neighboring countries.",
