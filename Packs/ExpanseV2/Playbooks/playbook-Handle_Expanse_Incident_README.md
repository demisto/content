Main Playbook to Handle Expanse Incidents.

There are several phases:
1. Enrichment: all the related information from the incident is extracted, and related indicators (IP, CIDR, Domain, DomainGlob, Certificate) are created and enriched.
2. Validation: the found IP and FQDN are correlated with the information available in other products:
   - Risky or non-compliant communications to and from the IP with external IPs as flagged in Expanse's Behavior.
   - Firewall logs from Cortex Data Lake, Panorama, and Splunk.
   - User information from Active Directory.
   - Public IP address from AWS/GCP/Azure public IP feeds to identify the Public Cloud region and service (i.e., us-west-1 on AWS EC2).
   - IP and FQDN from Prisma Cloud inventory.
3. Shadow IT check: based on the information found, the playbook can suggest whether the discovered issue corresponds to an asset that is known to the InfoSec team (i.e., there are firewall logs present, or the asset is protected by Prisma Cloud, or is part of an IP range associated to the company).
 4. Attribution: based on the information collected above, the analyst is prompted to assign this issue to an Organization Unit, which is a group within the company with a specific owner. The analyst can choose from existing Organization Units (stored in an XSOAR list) or define a new one.
  5. Response: depending on the issue type, several remediation actions can be automatically and manually performed, such as:
      - Tagging the asset in Expanse with a specific Organization Unit tag.
      - Blocking the service on PAN-OS (if a firewall is deployed in front of the service).
      - Creating a new Shadow IT issue (if the asset is detected to be Shadow IT and the analyst confirms it).
      - Adding the service to a Vulnerability Management system.
      - Linking the incident to a related Prisma Cloud alert for the asset (if the asset is found under Prisma Cloud inventory).
