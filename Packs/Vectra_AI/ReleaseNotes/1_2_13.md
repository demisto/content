#### Integrations

##### Vectra Detect
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.91134*.

- Added a retrospective search jitter of 1 hour when fetching incidents to ensure that Vectra events that triggered but haven't been published are ingested.  
- *Note: Due to the added jitter, duplicate incidents may be created right after the integration update.*
