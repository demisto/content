This integration allows to create incidents based on Vectra Accounts/Hosts/Detections objects.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 7.1 of Vectra Detect

## Use cases

1. Fetch accounts, hosts and detections from Vectra Detect.
2. Bi-Directional mirroring for accounts and hosts.
3. List and describe accounts, hosts, detections, and users.
4. List, describe, create, and resolve assignments for accounts and hosts.
5. List, describe, and create assignment outcomes.
6. List, create, update, and delete notes for accounts, hosts, and detections.
7. List, create, and remove tags for accounts, hosts, and detections.
8. List, assign, and unassign members in group.
9. Mark and unmark detection as fixed.
10. Mark all detections as fixed for accounts and hosts. 
11. Get detection's PCAP file.
12. Clean up all incidents in Cortex XSOAR by closing duplicate incidents from Vectra Detect.

## Configure Vectra Detect on Cortex XSOAR

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Configuration for fetching Vectra Account or Vectra Host as a Cortex XSOAR incident

To fetch Vectra Account or Vectra Host as a Cortex XSOAR incident:

1. Select **Fetches incidents**.
2. Under Classifier, select "Vectra Detect".
3. Under Incident type, select "N/A".
4. Under Mapper (incoming), select "Vectra Detect - Incoming Mapper" for default mapping.
5. Enter connection parameters. (Vectra Detect FQDN or IP, API Token)
6. Select SSL certificate validation and Proxy if required.
7. Update "Max created incidents per fetch" & "First fetch timestamp" based on your requirements.
8. Select the Incident Mirroring Direction:
    1. Incoming - Mirrors changes from the Vectra into the Cortex XSOAR incident.
    2. Outgoing - Mirrors changes from the Cortex XSOAR incident to the Vectra.
    3. Incoming And Outgoing - Mirrors changes both Incoming and Outgoing directions on incidents.
9. Enter the relevant tag name for mirror notes.
    **Note:** This value is mapped to the dbotMirrorTags incident field in Cortex XSOAR, which defines how Cortex XSOAR handles notes when you tag them in the War Room. This is required for mirroring notes from Cortex XSOAR to Vectra.
10. Provide the filter parameter "Tags”, to filter entities by specific tag/s for fetch type account and host.
11. Provide the filter parameter "Detection Category” and "Detection Type", to filter detections by the specified category and type for fetch type account and host.

**Notes for mirroring:**

- The mirroring is strictly tied to incident types "Vectra Account" and "Vectra Host", as well as the incoming mapper "Vectra Detect - Incoming Mapper". If you want to change or use a custom incident type/mapper, ensure that related changes are also present.
- The mirroring settings apply only for incidents that are fetched after applying the settings.
- Any tags removed from the Vectra Account or Vectra Host will not be removed in the Cortex XSOAR incident, as Cortex XSOAR doesn't allow the removal of the tags field via the backend. However, tags removed from the Cortex XSOAR incident UI will be removed from the Vectra Account or Vectra Host.
- New notes from the Cortex XSOAR incident will be created as notes in the Vectra Account or Vectra Host. Updates to existing notes in the Cortex XSOAR incident will not be reflected in the Vectra Account or Vectra Host.
- New notes from the Vectra Account or Vectra Host will be created as notes in the Cortex XSOAR incident. Updates to existing notes in the Vectra Account or Vectra Host will create new notes in the Cortex XSOAR incident.
- If a closed Cortex XSOAR incident is tied to a specific Account or Vectra Host and new detections for that Account or Vectra Host arise or existing detections become active again, the incident will be automatically reopened.
- When a Cortex XSOAR incident is closed but there are still active detections on the Vectra side, and the Account or Vectra Host is subsequently updated, the corresponding Cortex XSOAR incident for that entity will be reopened.
- If a Cortex XSOAR incident is reopened and the corresponding entity has an assignment in Vectra, the assignment will be removed from Vectra.
- If you want to use the mirror mechanism and you're using custom mappers, then the incoming mapper must contain the following fields: dbotMirrorDirection, dbotMirrorId, dbotMirrorInstance, and dbotMirrorTags.
- To use a custom mapper, you must first duplicate the mapper and update the fields in the copy of the mapper. (Refer to the "Create a custom mapper consisting of the default Vectra Detect - Incoming Mapper" section for more information.)
- Following new fields are introduced in the response of the incident to enable the mirroring:
  - **mirror_direction:** This field determines the mirroring direction for the incident. It is a required field for Cortex XSOAR to enable mirroring support.
  - **mirror_tags:** This field determines what would be the tag needed to mirror the Cortex XSOAR entry out to Vectra. It is a required field for XSOAR to enable mirroring support.
  - **mirror_instance:** This field determines from which instance the Cortex XSOAR incident was created. It is a required field for Cortex XSOAR to enable mirroring support.

#### Cleanup Duplicate Incidents

- Use the **Close All Duplicate XSOAR Incidents - Vectra Detect** playbook to clean up duplicate incidents. You can use **VectraDetectCloseDuplicateIncidents** script individually to clean up duplicate incidents.
- You can also schedule a job with **Close All Duplicate XSOAR Incidents - Vectra Detect** playbook in Cortex XSOAR to clean up incidents periodically. Refer to [this Cortex XSOAR documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/incidents/incident-jobs) for more information.

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

## Troubleshooting

### Receive Notification on an Incident Fetch Error

The administrator and Cortex XSOAR users on the recipient's list receive a notification when an integration experiences an incident fetch error. Cortex XSOAR users can select their notification method, such as email, from their user preferences. Refer to [this Cortex XSOAR documentation](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.13/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Receive-Notification-on-an-Incident-Fetch-Error) for more information.

##### The following are tips for handling issues with mirroring incidents between Vectra and Cortex XSOAR

| **Issue** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- |
| Mirroring is not working. | Open Context Data and search for dbot. Confirm the dbot fields are configured correctly either through the mapper for that specific incident type or using setIncident. Specifically, make sure the integration instance is configured correctly for the mirroring direction (incoming, outgoing, both) - dbotMirrorId, dbotMirrorDirection, dbotMirrorInstance, dbotMirrorTags.|
| Required fields are not getting sent or not visible in UI. | This may be a mapping issue, specifically if you have used a custom mapper make sure you've covered all the out of box mapper fields. |
| Notes from Cortex XSOAR have not been mirrored in Vectra | Tag is required for mirroring notes from Cortex XSOAR to Vectra. There might be a reason the note is not tagged as the tag needs to be added manually in Cortex XSOAR.<br>Click **Actions** > **Tags** and add the "note" tag (OR the specific tag name which was set up in the Instance Configuration).|

### Docker timeout issue for Fetch Incidents

- If you encounter a timeout error while fetching incidents, you can try adjusting the value of the `max_fetch` parameter in the instance configuration. Setting it to a lower value, such as 50 can help prevent the timeout issue. 

- Another way to address this issue is to increase the timeout of the Docker container. By default, Docker containers have a timeout of 5 minutes. You can increase this timeout to a higher value, such as 10 minutes, to allow more time for the fetch command to complete. Refer to [this XSOAR documentation](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.13/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Integration-Server-Configurations) for more information.

### Handling HTTP 429 and 5xx Errors

The commands and fetch incidents mechanism will do up to 3 internal retries with a gap of 15, 30, and 60 seconds (exponentially) between the retries.
