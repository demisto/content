## McAfee DAM
Make sure that the XML API interface is enabled on your McAfee DAM server (Settings > Interfaces > XML API), and that the configured user has read permissions to query DAM Alerts and Sensors (XML API).

**Important:** The user configured in McAfee DAM must have the *Use XML API* permission as documented [here](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/database-security-4.6.5-product-guide/page/GUID-9018582C-321F-46A3-AB12-FABF16FCE12B.html).

Instructions on how to configure and test the XML API for McAfee DAM are available [here](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/database-security-4.6.5-product-guide/page/GUID-E51275F4-B365-499B-879C-51FE6A6989BA.html).
