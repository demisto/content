Use McAfee Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) Integration to fetch Alerts (incidents) and query Alerts.

This integration was integrated and developed with version 4.6.x of McAfee DAM.

## Configure McAfeeDAM on Demisto

Make sure that the XML API interface is enabled on your McAfee DAM server (**Settings > Interfaces > XML API**), and that the configured user has read permissions to query DAM Alerts and Sensors (XML API).

**Important:** The user configured in McAfee DAM must have the *Use XML API* permission as documented [here](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/database-security-4.6.5-product-guide/page/GUID-9018582C-321F-46A3-AB12-FABF16FCE12B.html).
