To define a CrowdStrike API client, you must be assigned the role of a Falcon Administrator. This will allow you to view, create, or modify API clients or keys. Secrets are only shown when a new API client is created or when it is reset.

1. Log in to the Falcon UI.
2. Navigate to **Support** > **API Clients and Keys**.
3. From there you can view existing clients, add new API clients, or view the audit log.
