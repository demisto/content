#### Integrations
##### CrowdStrike Indicator Feed
- Fixed an issue where ***crowdstrike-reset-fetch-indicators*** got stuck due to having more indicators with the same timestamp than the **limit** configured.
- Added the **last_run** argument to ***crowdstrike-indicators-list*** command.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.8.37753*.
