## Creating the integration instance

To create the integration instance for either feed, you need a CrowdStrike API client and a CrowdStrike API client secret. To define a CrowdStrike API client, you must have the role of a Falcon Administrator. This will allow you to view, create, or modify API clients or keys. Secrets are only shown when a new API client is created or when it is reset.
