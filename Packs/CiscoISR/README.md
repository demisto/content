# Cisco ISR
This pack includes Cortex XSIAM content.

## Configuration on Server Side
You need to configure your Cisco ISR device to forward Syslog messages.

Perform the following in order to configure log forwarding:
1. Enter Global Configuration Mode by either typing **configure terminal** or **conf t**.
2. Input the destination of where the logs should be sent by typing **logging \<Hostname OR IP Address\>**.

The instructions above set the logging with default configuration values.

### Syslog Time Parsing Support
Support for syslog timestamp parsing is available with UTC timezone only. You will need to add the year and milliseconds to the product default datetime format.

## Collect Events from Vendor
In order to use the collector, use the [Broker VM](#broker-vm) option.

### Broker VM
To create or configure the Broker VM, use the information described [here](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Pro-Administrator-Guide/Configure-the-Broker-VM).

You can configure the specific vendor and product for this instance.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Data Broker** > **Broker VMs**. 
2. Go to the apps tab and add the **Syslog** app. If it already exists, click the **Syslog** app and then click **Configure**.
3. Click **Add New**.
4. When configuring the Syslog Collector, set the following values:
   - vendor as vendor - cisco
   - product as product - isr
