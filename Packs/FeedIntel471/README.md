Intel 471 provides you with an unparalleled global intelligence capability. Whether you’re scaling a global cybersecurity presence or just starting to build your team, we can help you fight cybercrime with better insights and tools than you’ve ever had before.

The Intel 471 feed provides access to threat actor details and malware indicators:
* Intel 471's Actor feed is an actor-centric intelligence feature.
It combines both a field-based intelligence collection and a headquartered-based intelligence analysis component.
This feed provides data from closed sources (typically referred to as the deep and dark web) where threat actors collaborate, communicate and plan cyber attacks.
* Intel471's Malware Indicator feed provides a high fidelity and timely stream of indicators with rich context. This feed allows customers to alert/block and gain an understanding of the latest crimeware campaigns and is for those that value timeliness, confidence (little to no false positives), and seek rich context and insight around the attacks they are seeing.

In order to access the Intel 471 feed, you need to have valid credentials.  For further information, please see:
