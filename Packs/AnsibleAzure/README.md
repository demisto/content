This pack enables you to integrate with Microsoft Azure Cloud services. Azure is a public cloud computing platformâ€”with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more. It can be used to replace or supplement on-premise servers.

This integration enables the management of Azure Services using Ansible modules. The Ansible engine is self-contained and pre-configured as part of this pack onto your XSOAR server. The Ansible modules have been exposed as XSOAR commands, and allow you to use them without needing to know Ansible.
