  description: In case of nested email files (for instance, an EML file inside an EML file), determines which of the email files to return as an output. "All files" - will return all nested email files as output, "Outer file" - will return only the "outer" email file as output, "Inner file" - will return only the most "inner" email file as output. In case "Inner file" was chosen together with the 'max_depth' argument, the inner email will be considered as the email in the depth of the `max_size` argument.

  description: Use only the force encoding when parsing the message, e.g 'iso-2022-jp'. Relevant to msg files only.

  description: Use only the default encoding when parsing the message with the detected encoding fails, e.g 'utf-8'. Relevant to msg files only.
comment: Parse an email from an eml or msg file and populate all relevant context data to investigate the email. Also extracts inner attachments and returns them to the war room. The incident labels themselves are preserved and not modified - only the "Label/x" context items that originated from the labels, and the best practice is to rely on these for the remainder of the playbook. This script is based on the parse-emails XSOAR python package, check the script documentation for more info.
