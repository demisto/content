Parse an email from an eml or msg file and populate all relevant context data to investigate the email. Also extracts inner attachments and returns them to the war room. The incident labels themselves are preserved and not modified - only the "Label/x" context items that originated from the labels, and the best practice is to rely on these for the remainder of the playbook.

This script is based on the [parse-emails XSOAR python package](https://github.com/demisto/parse-emails), check the script documentation for more info.

## Script Data

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Script Type | python3 |
| Tags | email, phishing, enhancement, file |

## Inputs
---

| **Argument Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| entryid | Entry ID with the Email as a file in msg or eml format |
| parse_only_headers | Will parse only the headers and return headers table |
| max_depth | How many levels deep we should parse the attached emails \(e.g. email contains an emails contains an email\). Default depth level is 3. Minimum level is 1, if set to 1 the script will parse only the first level email |
| nesting_level_to_return | In case of nested email files (for instance, an EML file inside an EML file), determines which of the email files to return as an output. "All files" - will return all nested email files as output, "Outer file" - will return only the "outer" email file as output, "Inner file" - will return only the most "inner" email file as output. In case "Inner file" was chosen together with the 'max_depth' argument, the inner email will be considered as the email in the depth of the `max_size` argument. |

## Outputs

#### Notes
We handle EML and MSG parsing differently when the email contains HTML. 
- If it's an EML and it has the **content-type** of *text/html*, the content of the body will be stored in the html field.
- If it's an MSG, we store the text inside the HTML in the text field and the HTML in the html field.
