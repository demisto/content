    Since a valid Base64 string has a length that is a multiplication of 4, when the string isn't dividable by 4
    the character '=' will be a placeholder to complete the string so it'll be dividable by 4
    ('=' does not change the decoded value).
    We first retrieve the remainder of the length divided by 4 and then subtract it from 4
    to know how much padding we need to append to reach the nearest biggest number that is a multiplication of 4.
    For instance, if the length is 17, then 17 % 4 is 1, this means we need to pad the string 3 times (4 - 1)
    to reach a length of 20. We deal with the edge case where the length is already a multiplication of 4 by adding
    a final modulo operation with 4 as the divisor.
