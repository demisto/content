### Command Examples
#### Without escape chars
``!ContentPackInstaller packs_data=`[{"id":"GoogleCloudCompute","itemVersion":"latest"},{"id":"GoogleKubernetesEngine","itemVersion":"latest"},{"id":"GoogleSafeBrowsing","itemVersion":"latest"}]` pack_id_key=id pack_version_key=itemVersion``

#### With escape chars
`!ContentPackInstaller packs_data="[{\"packid\": \"GoogleCloudCompute\",\"packversion\": \"latest\"}]" pack_id_key=packid pack_version_key=packversion`

### Troubleshooting
#### Mulit-tenant environments 
Multi-tenant environments should be configured with the Cortex Rest API instance when using this 
automation. Make sure the *Use tenant* parameter (in the Cortex Rest API integration) is checked 
to ensure that API calls are made to the current tenant instead of the master tenant.

#### General Failures
- Make sure the Core REST API integration is configured correctly, and clicking the test button returns success.
- Make sure you have a connection to Marketplace. You can check that by going to the Marketplace page in the Cortex XSOAR UI and refreshing. 
- Make sure the *packs_data* parameter value is in the correct format:
   - A list `[]` containing dictionaries `{}`. For each pack you want to install, add a dictionary with pack_id_key as the pack id key and pack_version_key as the pack version key as demonstrated in the command examples above.
   - The escape characters are in the right order and none are missing.
