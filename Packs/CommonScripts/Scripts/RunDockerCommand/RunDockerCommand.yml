comment: "This command will allow you to run commands against a local Docker Container. You can run commands like wc for instance with word count, or other types of commands that you want on the docker container. \n\nWe recommend for tools that you want to use that are not part of the default Docker container, to cope this Automation script and then create a customer docker container with /docker_image_create with a custom docker container to add any command level tool to Demisto and output the results directly to the context."
