comment: "This command will allow you to run commands against a local Docker Container.\
  \ You can run commands like wc for instance with word count, or other types of commands\
  \ that you want on the docker container. \n\nWe recommend for tools that you want\
  \ to use that are not part of the default Docker container, to cope this Automation\
  \ script and then create a customer docker container with /docker_image_create with\
  \ a custom docker container to add any command level tool to Demisto and output\
  \ the results directly to the context."
