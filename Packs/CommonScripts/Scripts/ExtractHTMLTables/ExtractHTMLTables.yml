  Find tables inside HTML and extract the contents into objects using the following logic:
  - If table has a single column, just create an array of strings from the values
  - If table has 2 columns and has no header row, treat the first column as key and second as value and create a table of key/value
  - If table has a header row, create a table of objects where attribute names are the headers
  - If table does not have a header row, create table of objects where attribute names are cell1, cell2, cell3...
