  \ is used to change the Remediation SLA of an incident, when the severity of the\
  \ incident changes for any reason. Please copy this script and make changes to your\
  \ liking.\n# The Configuration section is there to help you easily configure the\
  \ script with your desired SLAs.\n\n# The CRITICAL_SLA field defines the number\
  \ of minutes that you would want an incident with critical severity to have, in\
  \ its Remediation SLA field.\n# The NONCRITICAL_SLA field defines the number of\
  \ days that you would want an incident with non-critical severity to have, in its\
  \ Remediation SLA field.\n# The NONCRITICAL_SLA field can also be configured in\
  \ minutes if you want.\n\n# Note that the SLA can be set with a number that represents\
  \ minutes instead of days, like so: demisto.executeCommand(\"setIncident\",{'sla':\
  \ 30, \"slaField\":\"remediationsla\"})\n# but it can also be set with a number\
  \ that represents a complete date and time structure, like so: demisto.executeCommand(\"\
  setIncident\",{'sla': 2018-12-26T12:10:24Z, \"slaField\":\"remediationsla\"})\n\
  # To get the date+time structure, you can use timedelta, like so: newsla = now +\
  \ datetime.timedelta(days=2)\n# then, you would use this to convert it to the date+time\
  \ structure that can be passed to the SLA field: newsla = newsla.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00')\n\
  \n# Since this script is to be triggered by a change of a field, you may want to\
  \ make use of the changes to the field in your script.\n# For example, in this case,\
  \ when the severity of an incident is changed, we want to check if it is now critical,\
  \ or not. We do this by using demisto.args()['new'], to get the new value of the\
  \ severity.\n# The field changes can be obtained in the following way:\n# The name\
  \ of the triggered field is in: demisto.args()['name']\n# The field's old value\
  \ is in: demisto.args()['old']\n# The field's new value is in: demisto.args()['new']\n\
  # To print the whole argument structure, use this: demisto.results(demisto.args())\n\
  \n\n# ##### Configuration #####\nCRITICAL_SLA = 60  # In minutes\nNONCRITICAL_SLA\
  \ = 6 # In days\n\n# ##### Logic #####\nargs_sev =  demisto.args().get('new')\n\
