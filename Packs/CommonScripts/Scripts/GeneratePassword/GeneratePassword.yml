comment: "This function generates a password and allows various parameters to customize the properties of the password depending on the use case (e.g. password complexity requirements).  The default behavior is to generate a password of  *random length* including all four character classes (upper, lower, digits, symbols) with at least five and at most ten characters per class. \n\nThe min_* values all default to 0. This means that if the command is executed in this way:\n!GeneratePassword max_lcase=10\nIt is possible that a password of length zero could be generated. It is therefore recommended to always include a min_* parameter that matches. \n\nThe debug parameter will print certain properties of the command into the WarRoom for easy diagnostics."
