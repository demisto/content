It took a very long time to get this email to be sanitized for testing. It all began when I discovered that the encoding was different. So I ask our team lead. I say "Hey, we want to use this email for testing, but it's kinda problematic.". He said to send over the email and he would take a look. About a few days later I asked and I said "Hey, how is the sanitization of the email going?" and he replies back with "Nope, can't be done. It's too complex.". So I ask him what we need to do to get this to work. He leans in close and whispers in my ear "I need about tree fiddy". It was about this time I realized my team leader was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. So I told him, "Damn it monsta, get outta this email! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!"
