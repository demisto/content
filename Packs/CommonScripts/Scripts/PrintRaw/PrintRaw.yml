comment: Prints a raw representation of a string or object, visualising things likes tabs and newlines.  For instance, '\n' will be displayed instead of a newline character, or a Windows CR will be displayed as '\r\n'.  This is useful for debugging issues where things aren't behaving as expected, such as when parsing a string with a regular expression.
