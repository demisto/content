comment: Prints a raw representation of a string or object, visualising things likes
  tabs and newlines.  For instance, '\n' will be displayed instead of a newline character,
  or a Windows CR will be displayed as '\r\n'.  This is useful for debugging issues
  where things aren't behaving as expected, such as when parsing a string with a regular
  expression.
