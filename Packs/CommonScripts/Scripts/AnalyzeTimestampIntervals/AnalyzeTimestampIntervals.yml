name: AnalyzeTimestampIntervals
comment: Analyze a list of Unix timestamps in milliseconds, to detect simple patterns of consistency or high frequency. The script can aid in the investigation of multi-event alerts that contain a list of timestamps.
script: ''
type: python
tags: []
enabled: true
args:
- name: timestamps
  required: true
  description: List of Unix timestamps (in milliseconds) representing time intervals.
  isArray: true
- name: max_intervals_per_window
  description: The maximum number of intervals allowed within a specific time window.
  defaultValue: '60'
- name: interval_consistency_threshold
  description: The threshold for determining how consistent the intervals are (in seconds).
  defaultValue: '0.1'
- name: verbose
  description: If true, includes detailed interval information in the output.
  defaultValue: 'false'
outputs:
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.TimestampCount
  description: The total number of timestamps analyzed.
  type: number
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.MeanIntervalInSeconds
  description: The average time interval (in seconds) between consecutive timestamps.
  type: number
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.MedianIntervalInSeconds
  description: The median time interval (in seconds) between consecutive timestamps.
  type: number
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.StandardDeviationInSeconds
  description: The standard deviation of the time intervals (in seconds) between consecutive timestamps.
  type: number
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.HighFrequencyDetected
  description: Indicates whether a high frequency of intervals within a short time window was detected.
  type: boolean
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.ConsistentIntervalsDetected
  description: Indicates whether the intervals between timestamps were consistent based on the standard deviation threshold.
  type: boolean
- contextPath: IntervalAnalysis.IsPatternLikelyAutomated
  description: Indicates whether the pattern of intervals is likely automated based on analysis. Intervals with high frequency or consistency can suggest the use of an automation.
