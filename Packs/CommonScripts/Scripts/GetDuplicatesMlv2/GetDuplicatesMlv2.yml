comment: 'Find duplicate incidents candidates.

  Using machine learning techniques with pre-defined data (can also use data from
  the local environment), this script takes into consideration different features
  such as: labels comparison, email labels (relevant for phishing), incident time
  difference and shared indicators, which can be customized by the arguments.'
