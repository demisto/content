  The script takes one or more domain names and checks whether they're in the XSOAR list defined in the InternalDomainsListName argument. by default, the InternalDomainsListName argument will use the XSOAR list called "InternalDomains".
  The list can be customized by the user. It should contain the organization's internal domain names, separated by new-lines. Subdomains are also supported in the list.
  The results of the script are tagged with the "Internal_Domain_Check_Results" tag, so they can be displayed in war-room entry sections in incident layouts.
