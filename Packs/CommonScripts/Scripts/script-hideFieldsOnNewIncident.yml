  ## You can create a condition for the incident, which is served as a JSON object.
  ## You can view the original field settings and take necessary action - such as validate that the options are part of the global set in the field definition.
  ## You can view the current form type (new, edit, close) and take necessary action - such as show fields only in the close form.
