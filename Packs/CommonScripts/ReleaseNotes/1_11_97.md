#### Scripts

##### DBotAverageScore

- Migrated the script from JavaScript to Python.
- Fixed an issue where if all scores of an indicator are '0', a null value would be returned.
- Updated the script to ignore '0' values (which indicate an 'unknown' value) from average calculations.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.12.63474*.
