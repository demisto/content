#### Scripts
##### New: CheckFieldValue
- This script checks that a field exists (and contains data), and optionally checks the value of the field for a match against an input value. If a regex is not supplied, the script checks that the field is not empty. This script can be used with the "GenericPolling" playbook to poll for field population or that a field contains a specific value.
