#### Scripts
##### CreateNewIndicatorsOnly
- Fixed an issue where the value of an existing indicator had a different letter case than the indicator on input.
- Fixed an issue where the script tried to associate to the incident an indicator that was not created, as it might have been excluded.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.11.1940698*.
