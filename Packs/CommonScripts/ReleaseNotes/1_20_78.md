<~XSOAR> (Available from Cortex XSOAR 8.13.0).</~XSOAR>
##### New: CommandLineAnalysis

- New: Added a new script- CommandLineAnalysis that This script evaluates command-line threats by analyzing both original and decoded inputs. It assigns weighted scores to detected patterns, such as AMSI bypass or credential dumping, and applies risk combination bonuses for multiple detections. The total score is normalized to a 0-100 scale, with risk levels categorized as follows:

* 0-25: Low Risk
* 26-50: Medium Risk
* 51-90: High Risk
* 91-100: Critical Risk

The scoring mechanism provides a comprehensive risk assessment, considering both the severity and frequency of malicious behaviors.
