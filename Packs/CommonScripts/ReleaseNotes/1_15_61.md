##### DeleteContext

- Fixed an issue where running with `all=yes keysToKeep=DBotScore` resulted in a deletion of the `DBotScore` context key.
- Fixed an issue where running with `all=yes` and `keysToKeep` arguments returned a message that the keys to keep were deleted even though they were successfully retained.
