- Added features to collect file attributes of incident attachment files together with file entries in the War Room.

##### StixCreator
- Added support for *indicators* with keys that don't match the common indicator names, as long as their key contains a common indicator name, or their value matches the expected indicator value (e.g. 8.8.8.8 for ip).
