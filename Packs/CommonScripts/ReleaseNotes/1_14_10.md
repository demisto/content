#### Scripts

##### ReadPDFFileV2

- Added the argument **unescape**, and when set to *true*, the script will unescape the URLs that have been escaped. If you have a custom playbook that already uses this script, then the default behavior of this argument will be *false*.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/readpdf:1.0.0.89247*.
