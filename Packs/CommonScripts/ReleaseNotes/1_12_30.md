##### TextFromHTML

- Added the *allow_body_fallback* argument, which allows to use the full *html* as the body in case the input *html* does not have a `body` tag
- Added the *replace_line_breaks* argument, which allows to replace `br` tags in the html with line breaks in the extracted text
- Added the *trim_result* argument, which allows to replace leading and trailing whitespaces as well as collapsing multible empty lines in the extracted text to a single empty line
- Added the *output_to_context* argument, which allows to store the extracted text in context
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.74666*.
