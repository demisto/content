#### Scripts
##### ResolveShortenedURL
- Added support for resolving recursively shortened URLs, which can be adjusted using a new *redirect_limit* parameter.
- Added support for a built-in unshortening service (which will use Python's **requests** lib to follow the redirects).
- Added support for a new online unshortening service: **longurl.in** (previously only **unshortened.me** was used).
- Added a new *service* parameter, which allows you to choose the unshortening service to use.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.9.42476*.
