#### Scripts

##### StixCreator

- Added a flag for creating SCO indicators.
- Updated the process of generating IDs for SDO indicators such that a given indicator will have the same ID every run. This applies both when clicking on the button "Export (STIX)", and when running the script manually.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3-tools:1.0.0.58222*.
