- Added a new argument **use_internal_http_request** to allow users to choose between two request methods:
  - **false** (default): Uses core-rest-api commands. Works in most environments but may have issues in load-balanced setups.
  - **true**: Uses internalHttpRequest. Works better in load-balanced environments but has limited permissions and may fail when running from playbooks.
- Improved error handling for both request methods with detailed error messages and validation.
- This change addresses the conflict between [XSUP-59397](https://jira-dc.paloaltonetworks.com/browse/XSUP-59397) and [XSUP-60704](https://jira-dc.paloaltonetworks.com/browse/XSUP-60704), providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.
