#### Playbooks

##### New: Notify Stakeholders

This playbook automates notifying stakeholders via Slack v3, Microsoft Teams, or email. You have the flexibility to notify other teams via Slack, Microsoft Teams or Email by configuring the necessary integration. This playbook requires existing integrations with Slack, Microsoft Teams, Mail Sender or Gmail to perform these actions. If none of these integrations are found in your account, the playbook will exit with no action.

##### New: AWS Public Access Misconfiguration - Auto-remediate

Automatically remediates 9 AWS public access misconfigurations: 1 RDS database, 1 EBS snapshot, and 7 S3 bucket issues:

6. AWS Connect instance using publicly accessible S3 bucket
7. AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal
