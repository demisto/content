#### Integrations

##### Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/pan-os-python:1.0.0.6975992*.

- Fixed fetch incidents deduplication logic to prioritize timestamp over sequential number (seqno) field, preventing newer logs with smaller sequential numbers from being incorrectly filtered out.
