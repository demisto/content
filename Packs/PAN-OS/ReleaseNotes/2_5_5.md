##### New: PANOSQueryLogs

- New: Added the PANOSQueryLogs polling wrapper script, which searches Palo Alto Networks firewall logs across several log types (threat, traffic, wildfire, URL, data, correlation, system, and decryption). It provides flexible filtering capabilities including IP addresses, time ranges, network zones, rules, ports, URLs, file hashes, and custom query strings, with configurable result limits up to 5,000 logs. Security teams can investigate network activity efficiently, analyze traffic patterns, and perform forensic analysis across their Panorama and Firewall infrastructure through automated log retrieval. This script is dependent on the Panorama integration and can be executed against either a Firewall device or a Panorama device, depending on the configured integration instance.
