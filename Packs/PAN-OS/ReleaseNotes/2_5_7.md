#### Playbooks

##### New: PAN-OS - Security Advisories Vulnerability Check

This playbook takes a CVE ID as published on the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories page as input and checks if any Palo Alto Networks firewalls in your environment have PAN-OS software versions or GlobalProtect client package versions that are vulnerable to the specified CVE. It accepts an optional target parameter to check a specific firewall by serial number. If a non-Palo Alto Networks CVE is provided, the playbook will return an empty json output.
