##### New: PAN-OS - Add Domains EDL To Anti-Spyware
This playbook add domains EDL to Panorama Anti-Spyware. It assigns External Dynamic List URLs that contain domains to block to Panorama Anti-Spyware. You can create an External Dynamic List (EDL) and add domains to it using the Cortex XSOAR pack called "Generic Export Indicators Service".
We recommend using this playbook as a one-time job. ones EDL was created and assign to Anti-Spyware, domains can be block by adding them to the EDL.
