category: Network Security
description: |-
  This action is designed to temporarily disable firewall security policy rules from PAN-OS devices or Panorama management systems, primarily used for testing the impact of unused rules before permanent deletion. The action supports disabling across multiple rule types, including security, NAT, decryption, authentication, and policy-based forwarding rules. This action requires explicit user approval before execution due to its potentially disruptive nature - disabling the wrong rule can create security gaps, block legitimate network traffic, or inadvertently expose critical systems.
  Extreme caution must be exercised when using this action, as disabled rules may impact network connectivity and security policies, although, unlike deletion, disabled rules can be re-enabled if issues arise during testing. This action can be executed on a Firewall or a Panorama device, depending on the integration instance configuration.
args:
  - description: The exact name of the firewall rule to disable. This must match the rule name as it appears in the PAN-OS configuration. Rule names are case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as configured.
    name: rulename
    required: true
    type: string
    underlyingargname: rulename
  - description: |-
      Specifies whether to disable from pre-rulebase or post-rulebase (Panorama instances only). In Panorama, rules are organized in hierarchical rulebases:
      - pre-rulebase: Rules processed before device group rules, typically for organization-wide policies
      - post-rulebase: Rules processed after device group rules, typically for cleanup or final enforcement policies
    name: pre_post
    type: string
    underlyingargname: pre_post
  - description: The device group where the rule is configured (Panorama instances).
    name: device-group
    type: string
    underlyingargname: device-group
  - description: Serial number of the firewall on which to run the command. Use only for a Panorama instance.

  - description: |-
      The rulebase from which to disable the rule. Select ONE of the following options:
      - security
      - application-override
      - authentication
      - decryption
      - nat
      - pbf

  - description: |-
      The Virtual System (VSYS) identifier where the rule is configured. In PAN-OS, a VSYS is a logical partitioning mechanism that creates isolated firewall instances within a single physical device. Each VSYS maintains its own:
          - Security policies and rules
          - Network interfaces and zones
          - Routing tables and objects
          - Administrative domains and permissions
      Use for disabling local rules from a firewall via Panorama or to specify a different VSYS than set in Integration parameters.
