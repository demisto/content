description: |-
  Retrieves certificate information from PAN-OS firewalls and Panorama devices, providing visibility into certificate expiration status for proactive certificate lifecycle management. It queries locally configured certificates as well as those pushed from Panorama, returning details including certificate names, subject, expiration dates, and categorized expiration status (expired, expiring within 30/60/90 days, or valid). The results can be filtered to show only expired certificates and identifies the certificate source (local firewall, Panorama-pushed, or predefined). Note that this action is read-only and limited to certificates under Certificate Management - it does not modify certificate configurations or cover certificates stored in other locations within the PAN-OS system. This action can be executed against either a Firewall device or a Panorama device, depending on the configured integration instance.
