description: |-
  Checks if any Palo Alto Networks firewalls in your environment have PAN-OS software versions or GlobalProtect client package versions that are vulnerable to a given CVE published to the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories page. Non-Palo Alto Networks CVEs are out of scope for this action. The action accepts an optional target parameter to check a specific firewall by serial number. The PANOSGetSystemInfo action can be used to identify such a serial number in the topology of the connected Panorama or Firewall devices.
