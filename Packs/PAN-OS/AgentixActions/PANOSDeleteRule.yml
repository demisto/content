description: |-
  This action permanently removes firewall security policy rules from PAN-OS devices or Panorama management systems, primarily used for cleaning unused rules. The action supports deletion across multiple rule types, including security, NAT, decryption, authentication, and policy-based forwarding rules. This action requires explicit user approval before execution due to its destructive nature - deleting the wrong rule can create security gaps, disrupt network traffic, or inadvertently expose critical systems. Extreme caution must be exercised when using this action, as deleted rules cannot be easily recovered without proper backups, and incorrect rule deletion could result in network outages or compromise organizational security policies. This action can be executed on a firewall or a Panorama device, depending on the integration instance configuration.
args:
  - name: rulename
    description: The exact name of the firewall rule to delete. This must match the rule name as it appears in the PAN-OS configuration. Rule names are case-sensitive and must be specified exactly as configured.
    required: true
    type: string
    underlyingargname: rulename
  - name: pre_post
    description: |-
      Specifies whether to delete from the pre-rulebase or the post-rulebase (Panorama instances only). In Panorama, rules are organized in hierarchical rulebases. Optional values are:
      - pre-rulebase (Rules processed before device group rules, typically for organization-wide policies)
      - post-rulebase (Rules processed after device group rules, typically for cleanup or final enforcement policies)
    underlyingargname: pre_post

  - name: rulebase

    description: |-
      The rulebase from which to delete the rule. Select ONE of the following options:
      - security
      - application-override
      - authentication
      - decryption
      - nat
      - pbf

  - name: vsys
    defaultvalue: vsys1
    description: |-
      The Virtual System (VSYS) identifier where the rule is configured. In PAN-OS, a VSYS is a logical partitioning mechanism that creates isolated firewall instances within a single physical device. Each VSYS maintains its own:
      - Security policies and rules
      - Network interfaces and zones
      - Routing tables and objects
      - Administrative domains and permissions
      Use for deleting local rules from a firewall through Panorama or specifying a different VSYS than configured in the integration.
