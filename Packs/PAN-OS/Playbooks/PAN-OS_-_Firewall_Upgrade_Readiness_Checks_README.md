This playbook uses the PAN-OS integration to check NGFW device conditions that can affect its readiness to perform a PAN-OS upgrade.  Included checks examine the following:

1. Available disk space for the target version (base image + release image)
2. Presence of any uncommitted configuration changes
3. Whether device has an active support license
4. Whether NTP is configured and synced
5. Whether the latest App/Threat dynamic update is installed
6. For devices in HA groups, if devices in the group have:
    1. App/Threat, AntiVirus, and GlobalProtect Client are at the same level and compatible for HA failover
    2. Running configuration synchronized among peers

Playbook output includes a register of the checks performed, a brief description, and their result.
