# `unshorten.me` Integration (Community)

## Overview

This integration allows you to unshorten URLs using the `unshorten.me` service. It is useful for revealing the final destination of shortened links from services like bit.ly, t.co (Twitter), TinyURL, and more, which is a common requirement in threat analysis and phishing investigations.

To use this integration, you must request a free API token from [unshorten.me](https://unshorten.me/api).

## Configure `unshorten.me` on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for `unshorten.me`.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Token | The API token for your `unshorten.me` account. | True |
| Trust any certificate (not secure) | When selected, the integration ignores TLS/SSL certificate validation errors. Use with caution. | False |
| Use system proxy settings | When selected, the integration uses the system's proxy settings. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URL and token.

## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook. After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
