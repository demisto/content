## Overview
---

Security Hub collects security data from across AWS accounts, services, and supported third-party partner products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues.


 Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your AWS environment and resources. 
 It also provides you with the compliance status of your environment based on CIS AWS Foundations compliance checks.
 Security Hub collects security data from AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. 
 For more information about Security Hub, see the [AWS Security Hub User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html).
 
 When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the AWS Region that is currently active   or in the specific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration   or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region.   To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for each Region to apply the change to.
 For example, if your Region is set to us-west-2, when you use CreateMembers to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the master account is created only in the us-west-2 Region.
 Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invite was sent from.

For more information regarding the AWS SecurityHub service, please visit the official documentation found [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/securityhub.html).

    | Finding Type | You can set the type of the findings to be fetched: "Software and Configuration Checks", "TTPs", "Effects", "Unusual Behaviors", "Sensitive Data Identifications". For example, if you set the finding type to "TTPs", the integration will only fetch findings with the finding type that match TTPs.                                            | False |
    | Workflow Status | You can set the workflow status of the findings to be fetched: "New", "Notified", "Resolved", "Suppressed". For example, if you set the workflow status to "Suppressed", the integration will only fetch findings with the workflow status of Suppressed.                                                                                         | False |

7. aws-securityhub-update-findings (deprecated)

### 1. aws-securityhub-disable-security-hub
***
Disables Security Hub in your account only in the current Region. To disable Security Hub in all Regions, you must submit one request per Region where you have enabled Security Hub. When you disable Security Hub for a master account, it doesn't disable Security Hub for any associated member accounts. When you disable Security Hub, your existing findings and insights and any Security Hub configuration settings are deleted after 90 days and can't be recovered. Any standards that were enabled are disabled, and your master and member account associations are removed. If you want to save your existing findings, you must export them before you disable Security Hub.

## Incident Mirroring

You can enable incident mirroring between Cortex XSOAR incidents and AWS - Security Hub corresponding events (available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0).
To set up the mirroring:
1. Enable *Fetching incidents* in your instance configuration.
2. In the *Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents should be mirrored:

    | **Option** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | None | Turns off incident mirroring. |
    | Incoming | Any changes in AWS - Security Hub events (mirroring incoming fields) will be reflected in Cortex XSOAR incidents. |
    | Outgoing | Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents will be reflected in AWS - Security Hub events (outgoing mirrored fields). |
    | Incoming And Outgoing | Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and AWS - Security Hub events will be reflected in both directions. |


Newly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen direction. However, this selection does not affect existing incidents.
**Important Note:** To ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and AWS - Security Hub.


### Mirroring In Notes
The mirroring in works when the security-findings provider last updated the finding record. 
If a user updated an incident it won't show in the Cortex XSOAR incident.

### Mirroring Out Notes
The supported fields in the mirroring out process are:
- AWS Security Hub Confidence.
- Risk Score
- Comment
- Severity
- AWS Security Hub Verification State
- AWS Security Hub Workflow Status

**Important Note:**Mirroring out updates do not affect the value of UpdatedAt for a finding. These updates can be overwritten by the security-findings provider.

* Before updating a comment, make sure that you chose an owner to the incident in the Case Details section. Otherwise, the comment update won't work.

* Note: AWS Security Hub Verification State, AWS Security Hub Workflow Status fields can contain only 1 state/status.
