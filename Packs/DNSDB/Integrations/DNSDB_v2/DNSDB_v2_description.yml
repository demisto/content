## Farsight Security DNSDB®

Farsight Security DNSDB® is the world’s largest DNS intelligence database that
provides a unique, fact-based, multifaceted view of the configuration of the
global Internet infrastructure. DNSDB leverages the richness of Farsight’s
Security Information Exchange (SIE) data-sharing platform and is engineered and
operated by leading DNS experts. Farsight collects Passive DNS data from its
global sensor array. It then filters and verifies the DNS transactions before
inserting them into the DNSDB, along with ICANN-sponsored zone file access
download data. The end result is the highest-quality and most comprehensive DNS
intelligence data service of its kind - with more than 100 billion DNS records
since 2010.

The Farsight DNSDB® integration requires a subscription to DNSDB Enterprise
Edition, DNSDB Community Edition, or DNSDB Export. Please visit
https://www.farsightsecurity.com/get-started/ for more information about how to
get started. You will need to configure the DNSDB Integration with the API Key
and DNSDB server that is provided to you by Farsight.
