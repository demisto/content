  Farsight Security DNSDB

  DNSDB is a Passive DNS (pDNS) historical database that provides a unique, fact-based,
  multifaceted view of the
  configuration of the global Internet infrastructure DNSDB leverages the richness
  of Farsight’s Security Information
  Exchange (SIE) data-sharing platform and is engineered and operated by leading DNS
  experts.
