urlscan.io is a free service to scan and analyse third-party websites. When a
URL is submitted to urlscan.io, an automated process will browse to the URL
like a regular user and record the activity that this page navigation creates.
This includes the domains and IPs contacted, the resources (JavaScript, CSS,
etc) requested from those domains, file downloads that were triggered, as well
as additional information about the page itself. urlscan.io will take a
screenshot of the page, record the DOM content, JavaScript global variables,
cookies created by the page, and a myriad of other observations. If the site is
targeting the users one of the more than 660 brands tracked by urlscan.io, it
will be highlighted as potentially malicious in the scan results.

To use the urlscan.io integration, [sign up for a free user account and create
an API key first.](https://urlscan.io/user/signup)
