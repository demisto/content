Note: Support for this pack will be moving to the partner around September 1, 2021.

urlscan.io is a free service to scan and analyse websites. When a URL is
submitted to urlscan.io, an automated process will browse to the URL like a
regular user and record the activity that this page navigation creates. This
includes the domains and IPs contacted, the resources (JavaScript, CSS, etc)
requested from those domains, as well as additional information about the page
itself. urlscan.io will take a screenshot of the page, record the DOM content,
JavaScript global variables, cookies created by the page, and a myriad of other
observations. If the site is targeting the users one of the more than 600
brands tracked by urlscan.io, it will be highlighted as potentially malicious
in the scan results.

urlscan.io itself is a free service, but we also offer commercial products for
heavy users and organisations that need additional insight.

To use the urlscan.io integration, sign up for a free user account and create
an API key first: https://urlscan.io/user/signup

The urlscan.io content pack includes commands for:

* Submitting URLs for scanning with different levels of visibility.
* Using the urlscan.io Search API to find scans on the platform by a variety of indicators.
* Retrieves the HTTP transactions made for a given URL using the URLScan integration.
