- Fix the *scan_visibility* argument to the ***url*** and ***urlscan-submit*** commands. This argument previously defaulted to `public`, overriding any other visibility settings by default, including the integration-wide *scan_visibility* parameter. It is now left empty by default, thus properly respecting other arguments, parameters, and service provider-side settings related to visibility.
