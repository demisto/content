This integration checks domain information from the urlscan.io Database.
In order to submit URLs to scan, an API key is required.
We recommend submitting the URLs as private or unlisted, 
as publicly listed submitted URLs will be available to the public.
Contact urlscan.io to obtain an API key.

Notice: Submitting indicators using the ***urlscan-search*** command of this integration might make the indicator data publicly available.  See the vendorâ€™s documentation for more details.
