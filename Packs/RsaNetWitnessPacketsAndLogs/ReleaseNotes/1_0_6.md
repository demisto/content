#### Integrations

##### RSA NetWitness Packets and Logs
- Fixed an issue where the only possible option for SSL port was 56105.
- Added support for the *useSSL* parameter in all commands, allowing the selection of SSL with every port.
- Added the ability to output the result of the command ***netwitness-packets*** in the context data with the argument *renderToContext*.
