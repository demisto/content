| SpyCloud.CompassDataList.target_domain | String | SLD extracted from 'target_url' field. | 
| SpyCloud.CompassDataList.target_subdomain | String | Subdomain and SLD extracted from 'target_url' field. | 
| SpyCloud.CompassDataList.severity | Number | Severity is a numeric code representing severity of a breach record. This can be used in API requests to ensure only Breach Records with plaintext password are returned. Possible values are: 2 -&gt; Email only severity. This record is part of an email-only list. 5 -&gt; Informational severity. This severity value is given to breach records where we have a non-crackable password hash, or no password at all. 20 -&gt; High severity. This severity value is given to breach records where we have an email address and a plaintext password. 25 -&gt; Critical severity. This severity value is given to breach records recovered from an infected machine \(botnet data\). These records will always have a plaintext password and most will have an email address. | 
| SpyCloud.CompassDataList.document_id | String | UUID v4 string which uniquely identifies this breach record in our data set. | 
| SpyCloud.CompassDataList.email | String | Email address. |
