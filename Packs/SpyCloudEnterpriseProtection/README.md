## What does this pack do?

SpyCloud’s data includes stolen assets from third-party breaches, malware victim logs, and other sources on the darknet. With the SpyCloud Enterprise API you can automate your exposed assets to be pulled in as incidents in Cortex® XSOAR™. These incidents can trigger two different sample playbooks to be used to triage SpyCloud breach record and malware alerts. 

Additionally, the integration includes enrichment commands (along with sample Enrichment Playbooks) that can be used to look up specific details using the standard enterprise endpoints, including:

* Watchlist 
* Domain 
* Email
* IP Addresses 
* Username 
* Password

SpyCloud Compass users can also perform enrichment from additional endpoints, including:

* Malware-infected devices
* Exposed corporate applications (e.g., SSO, collaboration tools, CRM, etc.)
