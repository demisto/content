### gcp-compute-list-instances
***
Retrieves the list of instances contained within the specified zone.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-list-instances`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| zone | The name of the zone for this request. | Required | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional |

### gcp-compute-aggregated-list-instances
***
Retrieves aggregated list of all of the instances in your project across all regions and zones.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-aggregated-list-instances`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional |

### gcp-compute-list-images
***
Retrieves the list of custom images available to the specified project. Custom images are images you create that belong to your project. This method does not get any images that belong to other projects, including publicly-available images, like Debian 8. If you want to get a list of publicly-available images, use this method to make a request to the respective image project, such as debian-cloud or windows-cloud.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-list-images`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| project | Project ID for this request. if left empty configured project will be used. | Optional | 
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional |

| --- | --- | --- |
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional |

| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional |

Creates a firewall rule in the specified project using the data included in the request.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-insert-firewall`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. | Required | 
| description | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. | Optional | 
| network | URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used | Optional | 
| priority | Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 42, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority. | Optional | 
| sourceRanges | If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported. comma separated.  | Optional | 
| destinationRanges | If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported. comma separated. | Optional | 
| sourceTags | If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance&#x27;s external IP address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. comma separated. | Optional | 
| targetTags | A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. comma separated. | Optional | 
| sourceServiceAccounts | If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance&#x27;s external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. comma separated. | Optional | 
| targetServiceAccounts | A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. comma separated. | Optional | 
| allowed | The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted connection. Ex: ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80 | Optional | 
| denied | The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection. Ex: ipprotocol=tcp,ports=22,443;ipprotocol=tcp,ports=8080,80 | Optional | 
| direction | Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags. | Optional | 
| logConfigEnable | This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. | Optional | 
| disabled | Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled. | Optional | 
| project_id | Project ID that you want to run this command on. | Optional |

### gcp-compute-list-firewall
***
Retrieves the list of firewall rules available to the specified project.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-list-firewall`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional | 
| project_id | Project ID that you want to run this command on. | Optional |


##### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.id | string | The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.creationTimestamp | string | Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.name | string | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1\-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1\-63 characters long and match the regular expression \[a\-z\]\(\[\-a\-z0\-9\]\*\[a\-z0\-9\]\)? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.description | string | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.network | string | URL of the network resource for this firewall rule | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.priority | number | Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 42, both inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence \(eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority 1\). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.sourceRanges | string | If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. Only IPv4 is supported. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.destinationRanges | string | If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Only IPv4 is supported. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.sourceTags | string | If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance&\#x27;s external IP address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.targetTags | string | A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.sourceServiceAccounts | string | If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance&\#x27;s external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.targetServiceAccounts | string | A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network that may make network connections as specified in allowed\[\]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.allowed | Unknown | The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port\-range tuple that describes a permitted connection. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.allowed.IPProtocol | string | The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known protocol strings \(tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, ipip, sctp\), or the IP protocol number. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.allowed.ports | string | An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.denied | Unknown | The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port\-range tuple that describes a denied connection. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.denied.IPProtocol | string | The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be one of the following well known protocol strings \(tcp, udp, icmp, esp, ah, ipip, sctp\), or the IP protocol number. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.denied.ports | string | An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule applies to connections through any port. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.direction | string | Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify destinationRanges; For EGRESS traffic, it is NOT supported to specify sourceRanges OR sourceTags. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.logConfig | Unknown | This field denotes the logging options for a particular firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.logConfig.enable | boolean | This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.disabled | boolean | Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.selfLink | string | Server\-defined URL for the resource. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Firewalls.kind | string |  Type of the resource. Always compute\#firewall for firewall rules. |

### gcp-compute-list-snapshots
***
Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources contained within the specified project.


##### Base Command

`gcp-compute-list-snapshots`
##### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxResults | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500) | Optional | 
| filters | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. | Optional | 
| orderBy | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. | Optional | 
| pageToken | Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. | Optional | 


##### Context Output

| **Path** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.id | string | The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.creationTimestamp | string | Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.name | string | Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1\-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1\-63 characters long and match the regular expression \[a\-z\]\(\[\-a\-z0\-9\]\*\[a\-z0\-9\]\)? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.description | string | An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.status | string | The status of the snapshot. This can be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.sourceDisk | string | The source disk used to create this snapshot. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.sourceDiskId | string | The ID value of the disk used to create this snapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.diskSizeGb | string | Size of the snapshot, specified in GB. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.storageBytes | string | A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot creation/deletion | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.storageBytesStatus | string | An indicator whether storageBytes is in a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage reallocation. This status can either be UPDATING, meaning the size of the snapshot is being updated, or UP\_TO\_DATE, meaning the size of the snapshot is up\-to\-date. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.licenses | string | A list of public visible licenses that apply to this snapshot. This can be because the original image had licenses attached \(such as a Windows image\). | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.snapshotEncryptionKey | unknown | Encrypts the snapshot using a customer\-supplied encryption key.  After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer\-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the image later For example, you must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the encrypted snapshot in a future request.  Customer\-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot, then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.snapshotEncryptionKey.sha256 | string | The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA\-256 hash of the customer\-supplied encryption key that protects this resource. |

| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.labels.key | string | The label key. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.labels.value | string | The label value. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.labelFingerprint | string | A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this snapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up\-to\-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.licenseCodes | string |  Integer license codes indicating which licenses are attached to this snapshot. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Snapshots.kind | string | Type of the resource. Always compute\#snapshot for Snapshot resources. |

| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.warnings.data.key | string | A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings \(for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding\). | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.warnings.data.value | string | A warning data value corresponding to the key. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.httpErrorStatusCode | number | If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a 404 means the resource was not found. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.httpErrorMessage | string | If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as NOT FOUND. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.selfLink | string | Server\-defined URL for the resource. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.region | string | The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only available when performing regional operations. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.description | string | A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created. | 
| GoogleCloudCompute.Operations.kind | string | Type of the resource. Always compute\#operation for Operation resources. |
