##### New: Autofocus - Traffic Indicators Hunting
Created a new playbook that queries the PANW Autofocus session and samples log data for traffic indicators such as URLs, IP addresses, and domains. A simple search mode queries Autofocus based on the traffic indicators specified in the playbook inputs. Advanced queries can also be used with multiple query parameters, but require specifying all field names, parameters, and operators (JSON format). We recommended using the Autofocus UI to create an advanced query, exporting it, and pasting it into the relevant playbook inputs. Note that multiple search values should be separated by commas only (without spaces or any special characters). Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0.

##### New: Autofocus - File Indicators Hunting
Created a new playbook that queries the PANW Autofocus session and samples log data for file indicators such as MD5, SHA256, and SHA1 hashes. A simple search mode queries Autofocus based on the file indicators specified in the playbook inputs. Advanced queries can also be used with multiple query parameters, but require specifying all field names, parameters, and operators (JSON format). We recommended using the Autofocus UI to create an advanced query, exporting it and pasting it into the relevant playbook inputs. Note that multiple search values should be separated by commas only (without spaces or any special characters). Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0.
