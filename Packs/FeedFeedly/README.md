The Feedly feed provides access to articles with entities, IoCs, and relationships from your Feedly account.

You can ingest the articles as indicators using this pack. If you prefer to ingest them as incidents, you need to also install the FeedlyArticles pack.

In order to access the Feedly feed, you'll need to generate an access token. You can do it from [here](https://feedly.com/i/team/api).
