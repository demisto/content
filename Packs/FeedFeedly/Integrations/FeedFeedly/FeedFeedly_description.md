## Feedly

Use the FeedFeedly integration to import articles with entities, indicators, and relationships as indicators from your Feedly boards and folders.

**Note** There is a second integration `IncidentsFeedly` that can be used to ingest articles as incidents instead of indicators. This `FeedFeedly` integration is still needed, to ingest entities (intrusion sets, malware, TTPs) as indicators, and relationships between them. 

**Disclaimer** You will need the Feedly for Threat Intelligence package to enable this integration. You can learn more about our product here: https://feedly.com/i/landing/threatIntelligence

### Authentication

To generate an API for the application, go to [the api page on your account](https://feedly.com/i/team/api). We highly recommend that you create a separate token for this integration.
