For instance, the ExpressVPN [phishing site](https://cybersecuritynews.com/sophisticated-phishing-campaigns/) in this campaign downloads an SFX archive that mimics a genuine installer but delivers malware upon execution.\n\n After execution, the SFX file modifies the \u2018HKCU\\Software\\WinRAR SFX\u2019 Registry key and creates a \u2018expressvpn\\_windows\\_12.58.0.4\\_release\u2019 folder in %temp% with specific files:-\n\n * **expressvpn.exe:** This file is an RMS executable.\n* **expressvpn\\_windows\\_12.58.0.4\\_release.exe:** This file is a clean ExpressVPN installer.\n\n ![SFX Archive](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HVMUAg3bQx5KiR5Y0-xStUaZYYjVzbDVGMbzEHhAph1cM3pqIZHjrpNlzvcrntRVhi9uZiUBCCAnBFq6skEjNFNgXZfrZEK7rLhRbrjAmay9KWj4tJKMu8TOLjesN8pzCRe3m_3Dn__Y1zDrYerzTds)SFX Archive (Source \u2013 Cyble) The SFX file quietly runs an RMS executable in the background while simultaneously using the ExpressVPN installation wizard as a decoy to divert and confuse users.\n\n ![Process Tree ](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SxlJyO42OJdeXBATgQk5eHRPcimuVWOBOrAFj60oL0ONat_K432fVqb-LcZg2i1lVFfyigA2er6y6eYu_skVCgV6Z797-2W8OEr5-rNt8RBJDItiGboWSWI8w-8qhLcpRjQLAdc22D5_4bqnzZjyCms)Process Tree (Source \u2013 Cyble) RMS, initially a legitimate tool, has been used in campaigns by TA505 and other threat actors.

All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.
