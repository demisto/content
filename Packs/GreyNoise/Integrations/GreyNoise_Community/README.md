GreyNoise tells security analysts what not to worry about. We do this by curating data on IPs that saturate security
tools with noise. This unique perspective helps analysts confidently ignore irrelevant or harmless activity, creating
more time to uncover and investigate true threats. The Action allows IP enrichment via the GreyNoise Community API.

This Integration is design specifically for GreyNoise Community users and only provides the subset of intel available 
via the GreyNoise Community API.  
The [GreyNoise Integration](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/GreyNoise/Integrations/GreyNoise) 
should be used by customers with a paid subscription to GreyNoise.

This integration was integrated and tested with version 0.8.0 of GreyNoise Python SDK.
Supported Cortex XSOAR versions: 5.5.0 and later.

## Configure GreyNoise on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for GreyNoise Community.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
