GreyNoise is a cybersecurity platform that collects and analyzes Internet-wide scan and attack traffic. With this integration, users can contextualize existing alerts, filter false-positives, identify compromised devices, and track emerging threats.
This integration was integrated and tested with version 0.7.0 of GreyNoise.
Supported Cortex XSOAR versions: 5.0.0 and later.

## Configure GreyNoise on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for GreyNoise.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | apikey | API Key | True |
    | insecure | Trust any certificate \(not secure\) | False |
    | proxy | Use system proxy settings | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.
## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
