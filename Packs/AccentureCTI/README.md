# **Accenture CTI v2**
 
This pack has 2 sub-pack/integration namely:
- ACTI Indicator Query
- ACTI Vulnerability Query

This pack automates the detection of threats and the triage/investigation of incidents by importing **Accenture CTI (ACTI)** data and intelligence reports into the XSOAR platform. The incident-enrichment functionality not only alleviates tedious research tasks traditionally performed by analysts, but also automatically folds ACTI intelligence reports associated with a given incident into the incident. The result is a complete picture of what ACTI knows about any given threat the moment the analyst opens the XSOAR incident.
