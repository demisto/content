HackerOne integration allows users to fetch reports by using the fetch incidents capability. It also provides commands to retrieve all the reports and programs.
This integration was integrated and tested with API version v1 of HackerOne.

## Advanced Filter
The`advanced_filter` parameter used both in the `hackerone-report-list` command and in the integration configuration, is used to filter results based on attribute values.
The general filtering syntax is as follows:

```{"attribute": "value1, value2"}```
- `attribute` is the name of the attribute that the filter will be applied against.
- `value` is the value being checked for. You can specify multiple values as a comma-separated list for the attributes that are accepting the multiple values according to the API document.
- To specify multiple filters, use the comma ( , ) to separate them 
  (for example, `{"attribute1": "value1, value2", "attribute2" : "value3, value4"}`).

To get the detailed information regarding the valid attributes for filtering user can refer to the [HackerOne API documentation](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#reports-get-all-reports).
