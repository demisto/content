If you are performing research, please use your own accounts and do not interact with other people’s accounts or data.\r\n* Document your findings thoroughly, providing steps to reproduce and send your report to us. Reports with complete vulnerability details, including screenshots or video, are essential for a quick response. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.\r\n  *Reference HackerOne guidance on writing quality reports:\r\n   * https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/quality-reports.html \r\n   * https://www.hacker101.com/sessions/good_reports\r\n\r\n* We will contact you to confirm that we’ve received your report and trace your steps to reproduce your research.\r\n* We will work with the affected teams to validate the report.\r\n* We will issue bounty awards for eligible findings. To be eligible for rewards, reports must comply with all parts of this policy and you must be the first to report the issue to us. You must be 18 or older to be eligible for an award.\r\n* We will notify you of remediation and may reach out for questions or clarification. You must be available to provide additional information if needed by us to reproduce and investigate the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Response Targets\r\nWe will make a best effort to meet the following response targets for hackers participating in our program:\r\n\r\n* Time to first response (from report submit) - 1 business days\r\n* Time to triage (from report submit) - 2 business days \r\n* Time to bounty (from triage) - 10 business days\r\n\r\nWe’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.\r\n\r\n#  Program Rules\r\n* Do not try to further pivot into the network by using a vulnerability. The rules around Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection (SQLi), and FileUpload vulnerabilities are listed below.\r\n* Do not try to exploit service providers we use, prohibited actions include, but are not limited to bruteforcing login credentials of Domain Registrars, DNS Hosting Companies, Email Providers and/or others. The Firm does not authorize you to perform any actions to any property/system/service/data not listed below.\r\n* If you encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us immediately. Do not proceed with access and immediately purge any local information, if applicable.\r\n* Please limit any automated scanning to 60 requests per second. Aggressive testing that causes service degradation will be grounds for removal from the program.\r\n\r\n* Submit one vulnerability per- report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.\r\n* When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).\r\n* Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.\r\n* Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.\r\n* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.\r\n\r\n# Disclosure Policy\r\n* As this is a private program, please do not discuss this program or any vulnerabilities (even resolved ones) outside of the program without express consent from the organization.\r\n* Follow HackerOne's [disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).\r\n\r\n\r\n# How To Create Accounts\r\n* Go to our Website\r\n* Register \r\n* use @hackerone.com email address\r\n* Only use accounts you're authorised to access\r\n\r\n# Rewards\r\nOur rewards are based on severity per the Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).
