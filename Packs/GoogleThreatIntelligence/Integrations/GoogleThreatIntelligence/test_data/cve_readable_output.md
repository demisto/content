An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application. The attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user's rights.* | 18 | 0 | 0 | 0 | * An Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability exists that, when exploited, allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.<br>* This vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploited in the wild. Non-weaponized, proof-of-concept and weaponized code is publicly available.<br>* Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) considers this a Medium-risk vulnerability due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, offset by user interaction requirements.<br>* Mitigation options include a workaround and a patch. |
