SafeBreach is a platform designed to simulate cyber attacks against an organization's network. This platform allows companies to test their security posture and validate the effectiveness of their security controls. By continuously running simulations that mimic a wide array of attack techniques, SafeBreach helps identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other issues that could potentially be exploited by actual attackers. The SafeBreach platform employs a variety of simulators and collectors to execute and monitor simulated attacks across the entire digital environment, including networks, endpoints, cloud, and email systems. It incorporates insights from real-world threat intelligence and uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to provide comprehensive and realistic simulation scenarios.

For enterprises using SafeBreach and XSOAR, integrating this package streamlines operations by allowing you to operate SafeBreach through XSOAR, making SafeBreach an integral part of the enterprise workflows. This integration includes commands for managing tests, Insight indicators, simulators and deployments, users, API keys, integration issues, and more.
