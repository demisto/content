## Configure Anomali ThreatStream v3 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Anomali ThreatStream v3.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Server URL (e.g., https://www.test.com) |  | True |
    | Username |  | True |
    | API Key |  | True |
    | URL threshold |  | False |
    | IP threshold |  | False |
    | Domain threshold |  | False |
    | File threshold |  | False |
    | Email threshold |  | False |
    | Include inactive results | Whether to include inactive indicators in reputation commands. | False |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | True |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Create relationships | Create relationships between indicators as part of enrichment. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

### Configure Indicator Threshold Parameters
Each indicator has a threshold parameter and an integer `confidence` value that impacts the indicator's DBotScore calculation.  
The indicator DBotScore is calculated as follows:  
- If you do not specify the threshold parameter value in your instance configuration (recommended):  
If the indicator `confidence` > 65, the DBotScore value is set to 3 (Malicious).  
If the indicator `confidence` is between 25 and 65, the DBotScore value is set to 2 (Suspicious).  
If the indicator `confidence` < 25, the DBotScore value is set to 1 (Good).  
For example, 
If the **IP threshold** value is not specified during configuration and the IP indicator `confidence` value is 45, the DBotScore value is set to 2 (Suspicious).  
- If you configure the threshold parameter value:   
If the indicator `confidence` value is above the threshold parameter value, the DBotScore is set to 3 (Malicious). Otherwise the DBotScore is set to 1 (Good).  
**Note:** You cannot define a threshold that sets the DBotScore to 2 (Suspicious).  
For example, if in the instance configuration you set **File threshold** to 10 and the `confidence` value  is 15, the DBotScore is set to 3 (Malicious).

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

### threatstream-import-indicator-with-approval

| --- | --- | --- |
| confidence | The observable certainty level of a reported indicator type. Default is 50. | Optional | 
| source_confidence_weight | Ratio (0-100) between the source confidence and the ThreatStream confidence. To use your specified confidence entirely and not re-assess the value using machine learning algorithms, set this argument to 100. | Optional | 
| classification | Whether the indicator data is public or private to the organization. Possible values are: private, public. Default is private. | Optional | 
| threat_type | Type of threat associated with the imported observables. Possible values are: adware, anomalous, anonymization, apt, bot, brute, c2, compromised, crypto, data_leakage, ddos, dyn_dns, exfil, exploit, hack_tool, i2p, informational, malware, p2p, parked, phish, scan, sinkhole, spam, suppress, suspicious, tor, vps.

| tags | A comma-separated list of tags applied to the imported observables. For example, tag1,tag2. | Optional | 
| tags_tlp | You can add tags that are private to your organization by setting the tlp attribute for the tag to red. If you do not specify a tlp setting, the tag is visible to any ThreatStream user with access to the observable. Possible values are: Red, Amber, Green, White. | Optional | 
| expiration_ts | The timestamp when intelligence will expire on ThreatStream, in ISO format. For example, 2020-12-24T00:00:00. By default, the expiration_ts is set to 90 days from the current date. | Optional | 
| default_state | Whether the import job must be approved from the ThreatStream user interface before observables become active. When default_state is set to active, observables become active upon submission, without requiring approval. In these cases, an import job is created on ThreatStream which is automatically approved. Possible values are: active, inactive. Default is inactive. | Optional |

## Additional Considerations for this version
- Remove the **default_threshold** integration parameter.
- Add integration parameter for global threshold in ***ip***, ***domain***, ***file***, ***url***, and ***threatstream-email-reputation*** commands. 
- Add ***Include inactive results*** checkbox in integration settings for the ability to get inactive results.
### threatstream-search-intelligence
***
Returns filtered intelligence from ThreatStream. If a query is defined, it overrides all other arguments that were passed to the command.

`threatstream-search-intelligence`
#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | The value of an intelligence. | Optional | 
| uuid | The UUID of an intelligence. When several UUIDs stated, an “OR” operator is used. | Optional | 
| type | The type of an intelligence. Possible values are: domain, email, ip, md5, string, url. | Optional | 
| itype | The itType of an intelligence. (e.g., apt_ip, apt_email). | Optional | 
| status | The status of an intelligence. Possible values are: active, inactive, falsepos. | Optional | 
| tags | The tags of an intelligence. Comma-separated list. When several tags are stated, an “OR” operator is used. | Optional | 
| asn | The ASN of an intelligence. | Optional | 
| confidence | The confidence of an intelligence. Input will be operator then value, i.e., “gt 65” or “lt 85”. If only a value is stated, then it must match exactly. | Optional | 
| threat_type | The threat type of an intelligence. | Optional | 
| is_public | Whether the intelligence is public. | Optional | 
| query | Query that overrides all other arguments.

E.g., (confidence&gt;=90+AND+(itype="apt_ip"+OR+itype="bot_ip"+OR+itype="c2_ip")). | Optional | 
| update_id_gt | An incrementing numeric identifier associated with each update to intelligence on ThreatStream. If specified, then it is recommended to use order_by=update_id. | Optional | 
| order_by | How to order the results. | Optional | 
| limit | The maximum number of results to return from ThreatStream. The maximum number of returned results is 1000. For more results, use the page and page_size arguments. Default is 50. | Optional | 
| page | Page number to get result from. Needs to be used with page_size argument. | Optional | 
| page_size | The page size of the returned results. Needs to be used with the page argument. | Optional |
