## Additional Considerations for this version
- Remove the **default_threshold** integration parameter.
- Add integration parameter for global threshold in ***ip***, ***domain***, ***file***, ***url***, and ***threatstream-email-reputation*** commands. 
- Add ***Include inactive results*** checkbox in integration settings for the ability to get inactive results.
