## Configure Anomali ThreatStream v3 on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for Anomali ThreatStream v3.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Server URL (e.g., https://www.test.com) |  | True |
    | Username |  | True |
    | API Key |  | True |
    | URL threshold |  | False |
    | IP threshold |  | False |
    | Domain threshold |  | False |
    | File threshold |  | False |
    | Email threshold |  | False |
    | Include inactive results | Whether to include inactive indicators in reputation commands. | False |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | True |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Create relationships | Create relationships between indicators as part of enrichment. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

### Configure Indicator Threshold Parameters
Each indicator has a threshold parameter and an integer `confidence` value that impacts the indicator's DBotScore calculation.  
The indicator DBotScore is calculated as follows:  
- If you do not specify the threshold parameter value in your instance configuration (recommended):  
If the indicator `confidence` > 65, the DBotScore value is set to 3 (Malicious).  
If the indicator `confidence` is between 25 and 65, the DBotScore value is set to 2 (Suspicious).  
If the indicator `confidence` < 25, the DBotScore value is set to 1 (Good).  
For example, 
If the **IP threshold** value is not specified during configuration and the IP indicator `confidence` value is 45, the DBotScore value is set to 2 (Suspicious).  
- If you configure the threshold parameter value:   
If the indicator `confidence` value is above the threshold parameter value, the DBotScore is set to 3 (Malicious). Otherwise the DBotScore is set to 1 (Good).  
**Note:** You cannot define a threshold that sets the DBotScore to 2 (Suspicious).  
For example, if in the instance configuration you set **File threshold** to 10 and the `confidence` value  is 15, the DBotScore is set to 3 (Malicious).

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.

## Additional Considerations for this version
- Remove the **default_threshold** integration parameter.
- Add integration parameter for global threshold in ***ip***, ***domain***, ***file***, ***url***, and ***threatstream-email-reputation*** commands. 
- Add ***Include inactive results*** checkbox in integration settings for the ability to get inactive results.
### threatstream-search-intelligence

| --- | --- | --- |
| value | The value of an intelligence. | Optional | 
| uuid | The UUID of an intelligence. When several UUIDs stated, an “OR” operator is used. | Optional | 
| type | The type of an intelligence. Possible values are: domain, email, ip, md5, string, url. | Optional | 
| itype | The itType of an intelligence. (e.g., apt_ip, apt_email). | Optional |

| update_id_gt | An incrementing numeric identifier associated with each update to intelligence on ThreatStream. If specified, then it is recommended to use order_by=update_id. | Optional | 
| order_by | How to order the results. | Optional | 
| limit | The maximum number of results to return from ThreatStream. The maximum number of returned results is 1000. For more results, use the page and page_size arguments. Default is 50. | Optional | 
| page | Page number to get result from. Needs to be used with page_size argument. | Optional | 
| page_size | The page size of the returned results. Needs to be used with the page argument. | Optional |
