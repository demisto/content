- This section explains how to configure the instance of Threat Intelligence in Cortex XSOAR.  
  
1. Open Group-IB TI web interface. (It may be either new interface: [https://tap.group-ib.com](https://tap.group-ib.com))  
2. To generate API key(password):  
2.1. In the new interface: click on your name in the right upper corner -> choose **Profile** option -> switch to **Security and Access** tab -> click **Personal token** -> follow instructions to generate API token.  
3. Your server URL is the same as your TI web interface URL.  
4. Your username is the email that you use to enter in the web interface.
5. Set classifier and mapper with Group-IB Threat Intelligence classifier and mapper or with our own if you want so.
6. Go to Settings->Integrations->Pre-Processing Rules and set up the pre-processing rule:
* Set up conditions: "gibid Is not empty (General)" and "Type Doesn't equal(String) GIB Data Breach".
* Action: "Run a script".
* Script: "GIBIncidentUpdate" (will recreate closed incidents if they get an update, in other cases will update the existing one) or "GIBIncidentUpdateIncludingClosed"(will only update incidents). 
7. Don't forget to contact Group-IB to add to allow list your Cortex IP or public IP of a proxy that you are using with Cortex.
