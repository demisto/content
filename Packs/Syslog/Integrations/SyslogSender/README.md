## Overview
---

Use the Syslog Sender integration to send messages in RFC 5424 message format and mirror incident War Room entries to Syslog.


## Use Cases
---
* Send messages to Syslog via TCP or UDP or TLS.
* Mirror incident war room entries to Syslog.
* Track any activity from the Playground and War Room to your SIEM for improved visibility. This activity should be logged and attributed to the specific analyst.




## Configure Syslog Sender on Cortex XSOAR
---

### Usage example for rsyslog
To allow sending messages to rsyslog via Cortex XSOAR, the following lines have to be in the rsyslog configuration:

For TCP:
```
module(load="imtcp")
input(type="imtcp" port="<port>")
```

For UDP:
```
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="<port>")
```

### Usage example for sending War Room/Playground actions to Syslog

1. From the Incidents page, click an incident.
2. Run the ***!mirror-investigation type="all"*** command.
If you receive an * Investication mirrored to Syslog successfully* response, any action in the War Room will be sent to Syslog.

For example:
Run the command !Print value="test msg"

```
<14>1 2023-09-19T13:49:38.140870+00:00 a1427a8493b5 SysLogLogger 1 - - 29, 105@29, admin:   !Print value=" incident owner is ${incident.owner}"
<14>1 2023-09-19T13:49:38.162145+00:00 a4140f2eb707 SysLogLogger 1 - - 29, 106@29, DBot:    incident owner is admin
```

Syslog already contains the analyst name - admin (the user who performed the action).
The action is: !Print value="test msg"
The action result appears on the second line.

If you run the same command with a different user on the same Cortex XSOAR instance, the output will be:

```
<14>1 2023-09-19T13:56:02.152486+00:00 a1427a8493b5 SysLogLogger 1 - - 8069, 86@8069, jsmith:   !Print value=" incident owner is ${incident.owner}"
<14>1 2023-09-19T13:56:02.180858+00:00 a4140f2eb707 SysLogLogger 1 - - 8069, 87@8069, DBot:    incident owner is admin
```

Username (analyst) is present and located before each command.  In this case, jsmith.
The timestamp is present and loacated at the beginning of each string.
To determine the execution time (duration), calculate the difference between the second timestamp and the first.

### Integration configuration

1. Navigate to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.
2. Search for Syslog Sender.
3. Click __Add instance__ to create and configure a new integration instance.
    * __Name__: a textual name for the integration instance.
    * __IP Address (e.g. 127.0.0.1)__
    * __Port__
    * __Protocol (TCP / UDP)__
    * __Minimum severity of incidents to send messages on__
    * __Log level to send__
    * __Facility__
    * __Long running instance. Required for investigation mirroring.__
    * __Incident type__
4. Click __Test__ to validate the URLs, token, and connection.


## Commands
---
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
