## Access control
All the API requests follow the domain and domain group restrictions of the user. For example, if a user has access to only a few domains in their organization, the response to the APIs will be based on only those domains and domain groups.

## REST API Limitation
Email Security â€” Cloud REST APIs have a rate limit of 60 requests per minute per API route (/trace, /alert, and /quarantine) for every customer.
This means, in 1 minute, a customer can make:

60 requests to Trace APIs (parallel or sequential)
60 requests to Alert APIs (parallel or sequential)
60 requests to Quarantine APIs (parallel or sequential)

Within the minute, the 61st request to any of these APIs would throw a rate limit exceeded error.

The rate limit applies to the customer as a whole. This means that if the customer has multiple admin users who have generated API Keys, the rate limit is applicable at the customer level and not per API key. 

## Commands
You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSIAM CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
