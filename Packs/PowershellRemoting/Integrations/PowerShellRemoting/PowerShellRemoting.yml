description: "PowerShell Remoting is a comprehensive built-in remoting subsystem that is a part of Microsoft's native Windows management framework (WMF) and Windows remote management (WinRM).\nThis feature allows you to handle most remoting tasks in any configuration you might encounter by creating a remote PowerShell session to Windows hosts and executing commands in the created session.\nThe integration includes out-of-the-box commands which supports agentless forensics for remote hosts."
