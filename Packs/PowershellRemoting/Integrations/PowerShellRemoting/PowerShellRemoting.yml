description: "PowerShell Remoting is a comprehensive built-in remoting subsystem that is a\
  \ part of Microsoft's native Windows management framework (WMF) and Windows remote\
  \ management (WinRM).\nThis feature allows you to handle most remoting tasks in\
  \ any configuration you might encounter by creating a remote PowerShell session\
  \ to Windows hosts and executing commands in the created session.\nThe integration\
  \ includes out-of-the-box commands which supports agentless forensics for remote\
