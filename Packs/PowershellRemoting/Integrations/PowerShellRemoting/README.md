PowerShell Remoting is a comprehensive built-in remoting subsystem that is a part of Microsoft's native Windows management framework (WMF) and Windows remote management (WinRM).
This feature allows you to handle most remoting tasks in any configuration you might encounter by creating a remote PowerShell session to Windows hosts and executing commands in the created session.
The integration includes out-of-the-box commands which supports agentless forensics for remote hosts.

For more information about setting up PowerShell Remoting, see the [PowerShell Remoting - Configuration guide](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/Powershell_Remoting_-_Configuration).

## Configure PowerShell Remoting on Cortex XSOAR
