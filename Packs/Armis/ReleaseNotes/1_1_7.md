#### Integrations

##### Armis Event Collector
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.13.80014*.
- Updated the target dataset name for fetched activities, from **armis_security_activity_raw** to **armis_security_activities_raw**.
- Added an assignment from the **lastSeen** field of the fetched device records to the **_time** field.


#### Parsing Rules

##### Armis Security Parsing Rule
****
Deprecated the parsing rule, since the **_time** is already assigned by the event collector.
