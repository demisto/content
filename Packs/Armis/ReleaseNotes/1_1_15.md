- ***Breaking Changes:*** setting the new parameter to a non-zero value might cause duplications in the first few fetch-events intervals for existing instances.

#### Integrations

##### Armis Event Collector

- Added the **Minutes to delay** parameter to handle an issue where events were missing due to delays in Armis API. The default value is 10 minutes. A higher value can be configured in the event that some events are still not available within those ten minutes.
