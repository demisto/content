##Fetch Alert using an AQL

- Armis uses AQL syntax to query its database when presenting to the user meaningful information.
- As you navigate through the Armis GUI you will notice that at the top search bar an AQL string is created for each page displayed. By modifying the filters the AQL changes accordingly.
- AQL syntax allows you to granularly choose sub types of Armis alerts to ingest.
- If you have a desired fine-tuned alert you wish XSOAR to ingest through Fetch you can type here the AQL syntax
