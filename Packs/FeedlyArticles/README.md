The FeedlyArticles pack allows you to ingest articles from Feedly as incidents in Cortex XSOAR.

You will need to also install the FeedFeedly pack to ingest the threat indicators. Both packs work in tandem, so you will need to install both packs to ingest articles as incidents with all the entities ingested as indicators.

In order to access the Feedly feed, you'll need to generate an access token. You can do it from [here](https://feedly.com/i/team/api).
