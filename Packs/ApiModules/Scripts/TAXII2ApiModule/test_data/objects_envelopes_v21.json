        "description": "Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.(Citation: ESET FinFisher Jan 2018) \n\nUtilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, (Citation: Wikipedia Exe Compression) but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.

Extensive observation and research of Sofacy's activities over time indicated a profile closely mirroring the strategic interests of the Russian government. More recently, this group has been attributed to the GRU, Russia's premier military intelligence service as reported by the US intelligence community within several declassified public documents.\n\nSeveral high profile intrusions have been publicly linked to the Sofacy group, such as the German Bundestag, France's TV5Monde TV station, the Democratic National Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Ukrainian military.",

The criminal group behind IcedID also acts as an initial access broker for other criminal groups.\n\nIn an Active Directory (AD) environment, IcedID infections lead to network mapping, with criminals using tools like ADfind.exe, an AD enumeration utility [2]. Criminals use access from IcedID to collect information about AD users, systems, organizational units, subnets, groups, and trust objects.\n\nIn recent years, IcedID routinely has routinely led to Cobalt Strike and lateral movement within a targeted AD network. Cobalt strike is a known precursor to ransomware like Conti [3].\n\nIcedID is distributed through different campaigns run by different threat actors, but the end result is the same. Regardless of the distribution channel, IcedID causes remote access, data exfiltration, and follow-up activity like Cobalt Strike and ransomware.\n\n[1] https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/\n[2] https://thedfirreport.com/2021/06/20/from-word-to-lateral-movement-in-1-hour/\n[3] https://thedfirreport.com/2022/04/04/stolen-images-campaign-ends-in-conti-ransomware/",
