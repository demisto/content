The EWS API Module handles generic logic for interacting with an EWS Server.
It provides a client class for interacting with the EWS API as well as common methods for performing various EWS related operations such as getting or sending items, retrieving attachments, creating/updating/deleting folders, and more.

To use the EWS API module, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Configure an EWSClient instance with the necessary credentials, EWS server URL, and other connection details.
2. Use the functionality provided by the EWSClient and the rest of the API module or extend it to suit your specific requirements.

For examples, see the `EWSO365` and `EWSv2` integrations.
