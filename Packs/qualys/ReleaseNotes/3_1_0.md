#### Integrations

##### Qualys VMDR

- Improved fetch assets process when handling large objects - Assets larger than 1MB will be truncated, a key called 'isTruncated' will indicate that the assets were truncated.
- Improved the integration behavior in cases of timeouts when pulling assets - The integration will now immediately retry to fetch the assets instead of waiting for the next fetch window.
