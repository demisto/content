If you have a network with many assets, Qualys can detect vulnerabilities and policy compliance. 

## What does this content pack do? 

- Run scans for vulnerabliites and policy compliance.
- Create reports about the scans.
- Manage the hosts and assets on your network.

There are several playbooks in this pack. Each playbook launches a report or scan and fetches it when it is ready.

## Authentication

- Qualys Vulnerability Management uses basic authentication. You'll need your Qualys login credentials to use this integration.

- Qualys user accounts that have been enabled with VIP two-factor authentication can be used with the Qualys API, however two-factor authentication will not be used when making API requests. Two-factor authentication is only supported when logging into the Qualys GUI.
