## Authentication

- Qualys Vulnerability Management uses basic authentication. You'll need your Qualys login credentials to use this integration.

- Qualys user accounts that have been enabled with VIP two-factor authentication can be used with the Qualys API, however two-factor authentication will not be used when making API requests. Two-factor authentication is only supported when logging into the Qualys GUI.
