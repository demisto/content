The DSPM Valid User Response playbook is designed to assess and manage user responses to DSPM-identified risks. It checks the userâ€™s selected action (e.g., creating a Jira ticket or remediating specific risk types) and initiates the appropriate remediation or notification workflows. If no user response is received, the playbook logs the incident for future action, ensuring comprehensive tracking and response handling for DSPM incidents.
