comment: Identify whether the service is a "development" server. Development servers have no external users and run no production workflows. These servers might be named "dev", but they might also be named "qa", "pre-production", "user acceptance testing", or use other non-production terms. This automation uses both public data visible to anyone (`active_classifications` as derived by Xpanse ASM) as well as checking internal data for AI-learned indicators of development systems (`asm_tags` as derived from integrations with non-public systems).
