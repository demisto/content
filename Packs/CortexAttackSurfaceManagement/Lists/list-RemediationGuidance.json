Ensure the firewall’s administration panel is not publicly exposed to the internet.\\n2. Routinely update the firewall to run the latest version. Actively monitor the availability of new security patches and apply them as soon as possible.\\n3. Audit open ports and running services and ensure that anything active is critical for the firewall to function and run safely.\\n4.
