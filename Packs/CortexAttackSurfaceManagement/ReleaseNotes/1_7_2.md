#### Playbooks

##### Cortex ASM - Remediation Objectives

Updated the naming standard of the firewall rules to be in the format `remediation-<block|allow>-<vpc name>-port-<port number>-<tcp|udp>`, where the VPC name is truncated to 30 characters to meet the overall 63 character limit for firewall rule names. This ensures that unique firewall names are made in each VPC that a firewall rule could be created.

##### Cortex ASM - GCP Enrichment

Updated the playbook to only store VPC networks associated with the public IP address of the alert in the `${asmsystemids(val.type='ASSET-VIRTUAL-NET').id}` field (in the case that the VM has multiple interfaces on different VPC networks).
