#### Incident Fields
- **ASM - Dev Check**: Whether the asset is most likely used for solely development/non-production purposes, including uses like testing, staging, QA, sandbox, and user acceptance testing

#### Playbooks
##### Cortex ASM - ASM Alert
- Revises playbook to use new script `InferWhetherServiceIsDev` when calculating eligibility for automatic remediation

##### Cortex ASM - Enrichment
- Executes `InferWhetherServiceIsDev` as part of enrichment

#### Scripts
##### New: InferWhetherServiceIsDev
- Identify whether the service is a "development" server. Development servers have no external users and run no production workflows. These servers might be named "dev", but they might also be named "qa", "pre-production", "user acceptance testing", or use other non-production terms. This automation uses both public data visible to anyone (`active_classifications` as derived by Xpanse ASM) as well as checking internal data for AI-learned indicators of development systems (`asm_tags` as derived from integrations with non-public systems). (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).
