Change management for firewalls is a process in enterprises and organizations where a user wants to change a specific network behavior.  For example, if a user in an organization canâ€™t reach an application because the firewall is blocking it, the user may raise an issue for the relevant network team to allow this traffic. 

If you use PAN-OS or Panorama as your enterprise firewall and Jira or ServiceNow as your enterprise ticketing system, this pack will assist you to perform a well coordinated and documented process.


### What does this pack do?

- Manage your organization's change management process.
- Document the change management process in Jira or ServiceNow.
- Automatically edit the relevant rule for the change request.
