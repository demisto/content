## Tidy
### Description:
Usually, the main bottlenecks in an on-boarding process are the various software and programs required for the new recruit's computer.
Whether if it's a developer, customer success engineer, or a product specialist, on average it takes about three days to get everything up and running. Also, this process generally requires help from other colleagues.
The **Tidy** pack reduces the on-boarding process for new recruits to a matter of minutes.
The **Tidy** pack uses **Ansible** to connect to the new recruit's laptop over ssh and executing predefined commands.

### Main use cases
