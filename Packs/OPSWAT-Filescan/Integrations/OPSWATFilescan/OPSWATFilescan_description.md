## Prerequisites

For the integration you need your OPSWAT Filescan Sandbox API key.

You can generate it if you don't have one after logging in on the [Filescan Sandbox](https://www.filescan.io/users/profile) page under the My settings - API Key tab.

Copy the API key and insert it to the *API Key* field.
