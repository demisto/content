##### Cisco ISE

- Fixed an issue where the command returned an error where no results were found for the following commands:
  - cisco-ise-get-endpoint-id
  - cisco-ise-get-endpoint-details
  - cisco-ise-get-blacklist-endpoints
  - cisco-ise-get-endpoint-id-by-name
- Fixed an issue where the command **cisco-ise-update-endpoint-group** failed when mdm values are missing from the endpoint.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.99865*.
