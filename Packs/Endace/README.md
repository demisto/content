The **EndaceProbe Analytics Platform** provides 100% accurate, continuous packet capture on network links up to 100Gbps, with unparalleled depth of storage and retrieval performance. 
EndaceProbes enables analysts to find and solve challenging security threats like lateral movement, spoofed DNS, Command and Control (C2), and data exfiltration.
