description: "The EndaceProbe Analytics Platform provides 100% accurate, continuous packet capture on network links up to 100Gbps, with unparalleled depth of storage and retrieval performance.  Coupled with the Endace InvestigationManager, this provides a central search and data-mining capability across a fabric of EndaceProbes deployed in a network.\n                                     \nThis integration uses Endace APIs to search, archive and download PCAP file from either a single EndaceProbe or many via the InvestigationManager and enables integration of full historical packet capture into security automation workflows."
