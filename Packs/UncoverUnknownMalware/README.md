This pack allows you to uncover malware that was previously unknown to you, by comparing its SSDeep hash to other SSDeep hashes.
## What does this pack do?
Once the user creates an incident of type Uncover Unknown Malware and provides an MD5 or SHA256 hash, the playbook will do the following:
- Enrich the input MD5 / SHA256 hash to get its respective other hash types, including its SSDeep hash, or retrieve the file from an endpoint to obtain those hashes.
- Enrich existing indicators in the system, and create a pool of known SSDeep hashes.
- Enrich the input hash to get the malware family, verdict and analysis report from Intezer, and the community comments from VirusTotal.
- Compare the SSDeep hash of the original hash against the pool of known SSDeep hashes to find similarities to other files.
- Create relationships between all hashes of SSDeep hashes that are similar to the original hash.
- Search for incidents with any similar hashes which were detected based on the similarity of their SSDeep hashes, and link them.
- Search for all hashes that were deemed similar to the original hash based on the SSDeep comparison, across the organization's endpoints.
