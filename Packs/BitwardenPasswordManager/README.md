# Bitwarden Password Manager 
  
Bitwarden Password Manager integrates with Palo Alto Networkâ€™s Cortex XSIAM to fetch records of events that occur within your Teams or Enterprise organization. 
Bitwarden is the best password manager for securely storing, managing, and sharing sensitive online data such as passwords, passkeys, credit cards, and more.

## What does this pack do?
- **Fetch Events**: When you select this option on the Configuration page, Cortex XSIAM will fetch events every minute without duplicating events.
- **Get Events**: Utilize 'bitwarden-get-events' in the Playground to retrieve events, where you have the flexibility to customize the time frame, apply limits, and integrate the results into the XSIAM dataset.

For more information, see the integration documentation.
