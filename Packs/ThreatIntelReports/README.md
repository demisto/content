Threat intel reports summarize and share threat intelligence research conducted within your organization by threat analysts and threat hunters. Threat intelligence reports help you to communicate the current threat landscape to internal and external stakeholders, whether in the form of high-level summary reports for C-level executives, or detailed, tactical reports for the SOC and other security stakeholders.
