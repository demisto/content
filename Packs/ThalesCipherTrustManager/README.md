# Thales CipherTrust Manager

Thales CipherTrust Manager integrates with Palo Alto Networkâ€™s Cortex XSOAR to streamline the management of sensitive data and secure access. The integration provides security teams with essential tools to configure, manage, and monitor user groups and digital certificates efficiently. For instance, when a suspicious action is detected within the CipherTrust Manager, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual certificate requests, security teams can immediately modify user permissions, enforce stricter authentication processes, or revoke compromised certificates.


## What does this pack do?

This pack provides comprehensive tools and functionalities centered around three main use cases to enhance security and management within the platform:

- **Groups Management**: It allows for the organization and definition of permissions within User Defined and System Defined Groups. This is essential for structuring operational hierarchy and ensuring effective access control across the platform.

- **Users Management**: The pack supports efficient user account management with secure access capabilities. It facilitates authentication across multiple systems, including LDAP and AD, enabling a streamlined and secure user management process.

- **Certificate Authority Management**: The pack includes features for managing digital certificates, which are vital for maintaining secure communication channels. It enables the creation and management of both local and external Certificate Authorities (CAs), and the generation and issuance of certificates to ensure communication security.


### Use Cases
