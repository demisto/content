##### New: Reco-Google-Drive-Revoke-Permissions

- This workflow enables you to easily list the permissions of files stored in Google Drive, giving you visibility into who has access to your organization's data. If a file's permission is publicly exposed, the workflow restricts access to the file to prevent unauthorized use. Similarly, if a file's permission is set to accessible by all org users and shared with internal users, access to the file is restricted to authorized users only. Using the Google Drive API and built-in conditional logic, this workflow helps you secure sensitive data and streamline your organization's data management.
