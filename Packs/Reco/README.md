# Reco

Reco is a SaaS data security company that provides insights and visibility into data risks with business context for data shared across today’s collaboration SaaS tools. 
With a data centric approach, Reco allows IT and Security teams to automatically discover and map their sensitive data to provide visibility, detection and control over data and across users within their expanding SaaS based environments.  
Reco is able to significantly save time and resources by automating the mapping, classification, and tagging of unstructured data and then applying analytics across the interactions of users and data from SaaS tools such as Slack, O365, Google Workspace, and GitHub.  This helps enterprises quickly mitigate risks such as data exposure, misconfigurations, unauthorized data sharing, and insider risk.
