# Reco
Reco is the leader in Dynamic SaaS Security — the only approach that eliminates the SaaS Security Gap (the growing gap between what you can protect and what’s outpacing your security). 
This gap is driven by SaaS Sprawl — the proliferation of apps, AI, and identities; the challenge of keeping their configurations secure amidst constant updates, and the challenge of finding threats hidden within an ever-growing number of events. Dynamic SaaS Security by Reco keeps pace with this sprawl, no matter how fast it evolves.
The Reco and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR integration empower organizations to automate SaaS threat detection and remediation workflows for enhanced protection. Reco integrates with over 985 Cortex XSOAR content packs, the market’s leading SOAR platform.
