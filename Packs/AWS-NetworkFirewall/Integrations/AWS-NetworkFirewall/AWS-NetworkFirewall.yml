description: AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion
  detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
  With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
  includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway,
  or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible
  with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine.

      description: 'An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Network
        Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the firewall. The token
        marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request.  To make
        an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request.
        Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether
        the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it. To make a conditional
        change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network
        Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn''t changed since
        you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException.
        If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with
        a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again
        using the new token. '
