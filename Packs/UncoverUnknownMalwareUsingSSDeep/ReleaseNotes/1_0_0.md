##### New: Uncover Unknown Malware Using SSDeep
- This playbook leverages the case management and TIM aspects of XSOAR to uncover unknown malware.
The playbook does the following:
- Gets the SSDeep hash of a known malicious MD5 or SHA256 hash by enriching the hash via VirusTotal, and attempting to retrieve the related file from an endpoint.
- Creates relationships between otherwise unknown indicators - based on their correspondence to the SSDeep that was deemed similar to the original SSDeep of the malicious hash.
- Links incidents that had any of the indicators which were found related based on the SSDeep hash similarity.
- Enriches the original hash to get the threat actor, malware family and VirusTotal community comments.

These steps allow the analyst to find new files, incidents and endpoints which could be related to the the original hash that was searched simply based on the similarity of SSDeep hashes.

#### Incident Fields
- **Similar File Hashes Based on SSDeep** A table showing SSDeep hashes similar to that of the original hash.
