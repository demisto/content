#### Integrations
##### Securonix
- Update the incident name created in the **fetch-incidents** command.
 The incident name will be according to the *Threat Model* field, if it does not exist it will be according to the *Policy* field
 and if neither of them exist it will be the incident ID with the violator ID.
 This update is due to a change in Securonix API.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.4.30607*.
