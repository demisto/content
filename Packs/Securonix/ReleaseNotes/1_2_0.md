- Updated the incident name created in the ***fetch-incidents*** command.
 The incident name will be according to the *Threat Model* field. If it does not exist, it will be according to the *Policy* field.
 If neither field exists, the incident name will be the incident ID combined with the violator ID.
 This update is due to a change in the Securonix API and suggestions from the Securonix support team.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.4.30607*.
