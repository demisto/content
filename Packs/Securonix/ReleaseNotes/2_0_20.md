#### Incident Fields

- New: **Securonix Policy Type**

#### Integrations

##### Securonix

- Updated the ***securonix-list-activity-data*** and ***securonix-list-violation-data*** commands for the improved *query* argument by adding the support for the escape characters "\", "*", and "?" when passing them to the API. No action required by the customer.
- Added a new argument "policy_type" to the ***securonix-list-violation-data*** command.
- Updated the retry mechanism for the ***securonix-list-violation-data*** command to dynamically set the "to" argument to the current time based on the specified policy types: Land Speed, DIRECTIVE, BEACONING, TIER2.
- Updated the ***securonix-list-activity-data*** command to support the optional index key in the query argument. If the index is not specified in the query, it will append and search in the activity index on the Spotter API by default.
- Fixed an issue with the handling of special characters in the HR (Human Readable) for the following commands:
  - ***securonix-list-incident***
  - ***securonix-get-incident***
  - ***securonix-list-violation-data***
  - ***securonix-list-activity-data***
- Improved implementation with the Securonix Build version "6.4_Apr2024_R1". Starting from version 2.0.20 and onwards, the Securonix Build version "6.4_Apr2024_R1" is necessary for proper functionality.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.14.91134*.
