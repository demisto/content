  Retrieves detailed information about a specified Active Directory (AD) user.
  The details includes data regarding the specified user's manager.
  It typically returns attributes such as username, display name, email, department, account status, and group memberships.
  This command is useful for security operations, investigations, and automation workflows that require up-to-date AD user information.
  It can help teams quickly verify user details, identify access privileges, and detect suspicious or inactive accounts in the environment.

  If no filter is specified, all users are returned.
