#### Integrations
##### Active Directory Query v2
- Fixed an issue where an array was created under ActiveDirectory context prefix, in the ***ad-get-user***, ***ad-get-computer***, ***ad-get-group-members***, ***ad-search*** commands, due to the PageCookie context path insertion (introduced in version 1.5.0).
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3-tools:1.0.0.35208*.
