The SOC team needs to communicate and respond to end-users to get more details about an alert, continue with an investigation, etc, usually using emails. 
 
This email communications content pack enables security teams to automate the communication and notification process with end users.
 
With this Content Pack, you can use the layout as-is for email communication. It can also be used for other incident types by adding the email communication layout to the different incident types.

##### What does this pack do?
The layout helps you communicate and respond to emails in the Cortex XSOAR system:
- Add CC to the email
- Write the email you want to send
- Add attachments if needed to the email.
- Tag all the related emails (incoming/outgoing) to the incident and manage as an email thread - the user can view all the communications in the layout without leaving the system.

This pack includes, out of the box, a full layout, scripts, and incident fields. All of these are customizable to suit the needs of your organization.
