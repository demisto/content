The SOC team needs to communicate and respond to end-users to get more details about an alert, continue with the investigation, or notify end-users (and more), usually using emails. 
 
This email communications content pack enables security teams to automate the communication and notification process with end users.
 
With this Content Pack, you can use the layout as-is for email communication. It can also be in use for other incident types by adding the email communication layout to the different incident types.

##### What does this pack do?
The layout helps you communicate and respond to emails in the Cortex XSOAR system:
- Add CC to the email
- Write the email you want to send
- Add attachments if needed to the email.
- Tag all the related emails (incoming/outgoing) to the incident as email thread - So the user can view all the threads in the layout without leaving the system.

As part of this pack, you will get out-of-the-box, a full layout, scripts, and incident fields. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.
