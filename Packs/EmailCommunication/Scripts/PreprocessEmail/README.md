This script checks incoming emails from the incident type. If the emails contain an 8-digit hash in the email subject, the script will add the email response to the existing incident in the War Room with the "email-thread" tag. If there is no 8-digit hash in the email subject, the preprocessing will open a new incident for this email.

**Note:** In order to avoid performance issues, incoming emails will be added to an existing incident as "email-thread" only if the incident was **modified** in the last 60 days.
If you wish to extend this period, navigate to Settings->Advanced->Lists and add a new list with the name `XSOAR - Email Communication Days To Query`. In the `Data` field fill in a single number representing the number of days to query back, for example: 90.

The script is a part of the Email Communication pack.
