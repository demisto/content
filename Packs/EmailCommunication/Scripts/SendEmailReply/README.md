The script sends the email to the recipient's list, including the following information:
- The original email. 
- The name of the sender.
- The person to reply to.
- CC addresses, if they exist.
- BCC addresses, if they exist (Email Threads layout only)
- Attachments, if they exist.

For the "Email Communication" layout, the email body is taken from the incident 'notes,' and the email subject will contain the incident ID and the incident name.

For the "Email Threads" layout, email message details (recipients, subject, email body, etc) are set in Incident fields, as well as extracted from any previous messages on the same email thread.  Outbound email subjects will include a unique message ID and a custom subject line set when the first message in the thread is created.

The script is a part of the Email Communication pack.

### Troubleshooting
Multi-tenant environments should be configured with the Cortex Rest API instance when using this 
automation. Make sure the *Use tenant* parameter (in the Cortex Rest API integration) is checked 
to ensure that API calls are made to the current tenant instead of the master tenant.
