## Cloud Token Theft Response Playbook

The **Cloud Token Theft Response Playbook** provides a structured and comprehensive flow to effectively respond to and mitigate alerts involving the theft of cloud tokens. The playbook supports AWS, GCP, and Azure and executes the following:

**Cloud Enrichment:**
- Enriches the involved resources.
- Enriches the involved identities.
- Enriches the involved IPs.

**Verdict Decision Tree:**
- Determines the appropriate verdict based on the investigation findings.

**Early Containment using the Cloud Response - Generic Playbook:**
- Implements early containment measures to prevent further impact.

**Cloud Persistence Threat Hunting:**
- Conducts threat hunting activities to identify any cloud persistence techniques.

**Enriching and Responding to Hunting Findings:**
- Performs additional enrichment and responds to the findings from threat hunting.

**Verdict Handling:**
- Handles false positives identified during the investigation.
- Handles true positives by initiating appropriate response actions.
