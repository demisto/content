3. In the **Users** section, click **New**.
4. Enter a name in the **Username** field.
5. In the **Authentication** section, type and confirm the API user password in the **Password and ConfirmPassword** fields. If external authenticators are available, an **Other** checkbox and a list of authenticators appears in the **Authentication** section. To use an external authenticator for the API user, select the **Other** checkbox, and then select an authenticator from the list.
6. In the **Extra Information** section, set the following parameters for the API user. 
    - E-mail Address (required) 
    - Phone number (optional)
7. In the **User Access** section, define the user type, security, and history privileges, and access type.
    - Type of User: select either Non-Administrator or Administrator. Non-Administrator users have access only to DNS and IPAM management functions. Administrator users have unlimited access to all Address Manager functions.

API users can access Address Manager only through the API. GUI and API users can access Address Manager either through the Address Manager web interface or the API.
8. In the **Assign to Group** section, To assign the user to one or more existing user groups, go to Assign to Group section, and enter the name of a use group. Select a name from the list, and then click **Add**.
