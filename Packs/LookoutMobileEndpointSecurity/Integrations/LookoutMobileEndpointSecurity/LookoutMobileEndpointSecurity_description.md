### Creating an Application Key

You must create an application key specific to your Lookout tenant to properly authenticate your application. You can do this from the [Lookout Mobile Endpoint Protection Console](https://app.lookout.com/):

1. Log into the Lookout Mobile Endpoint Protection Console as an administrator.
2. In the left navigation bar, navigate to **System** > **Application Keys:**
*NOTE:* If you donâ€™t see the Application Keys tab, contact Lookout Enterprise Support to enable this feature on your tenant.
3. Click **GENERATE KEY**.
Enter a label name and click **Next**.
4. Copy the key from your clipboard into the configuration for your application.
*IMPORTANT:* Copy the generated key to your application immediately as you cannot access the key again after this procedure.
