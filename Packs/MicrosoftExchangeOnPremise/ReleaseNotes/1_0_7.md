##### EWS v2

- Fixed an issue in the **ews-get-contacts** command where the headline of the human-readable was invalid when the **target-mailbox** argument was not used.
- Fixed an issue in the **ews-delete-items** command where the command failed when providing *item-ids* which were malformed.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py-ews:1.0.0.49868*.
