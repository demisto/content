#### Integrations

##### EWS v2

- Fixed an issue where the *Fetch* failed to handle attachments that could not be opened.
  The integration now gracefully skips such attachments and allowing the process to continue with other attachments.
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py-ews:5.5.0.118073*.
