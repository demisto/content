Finds tables inside HTML and extract the contents into objects using the following logic:
- If the table has a single column, just create an array of strings from the values.
- If the table has 2 columns and has no header row, treat the first column as the key and the second column as the value and create a table for the key/value.
- If the table has a header row, create a table of objects where the attribute names are the headers.
- If the table does not have a header row, create table of objects where attribute names are cell1, cell2, cell3...
