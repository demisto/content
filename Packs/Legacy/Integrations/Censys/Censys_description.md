Two commands aspects of the Censys.io API is available, Search (cen-search) and View (cen-view). Cen-view is the primary interface. Automations should take the output of cen-view to parse and display the relevant data. Cen-search requires a more advanced search syntax and should be used primarily in pivoting and hypersearch scripts. More information on the search syntax can be found: https://censys.io/api/v1/docs/search
