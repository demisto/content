detaileddescription: "1. **Create a Service Account**  \nFollow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount)\
  \ in the \"Creating a Service Account\" section.\n---\n2. **Delegate Domain Wide\
  \ Authority and Authorize API Access**  \nIf you wish the Service Account to have\
  \ authorized access to all Google Cloud Platform resources on behalf of all users\
  \ for the associated G Suite domain then follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority)\
  \ to Delegate Domain Wide Authority.\n---\n3. **Enable Access to the Google Resource\
  \ Manager API**   \nIn Google Cloud Platform console Dashboard page for the project\
  \ in which you created the Service Account scroll to the Getting Started section\
  \ and click on \"Explore and enable APIs\". Alternatively you can click the Navigation\
  \ Menu button in the top left and in the navigation menu click the \"APIs & Services\"\
  \ button. Towards the top of the page click the button that says \"+ ENABLE APIS\
  \ AND SERVICES\". Search \"google resource manager\" in the search bar and enable\
  \ the API.\n---\n4. **Grant Permissions**  \nIn order for the Service Account to\
  \ carry out certain Google Resource Manager API commands, it is required that you\
  \ grant the Service Account roles with the necessary permissions. To give the Service\
  \ Account Organization-wide permissions, navigate to your organization's page. You\
  \ can do this by clicking the Navigation Menu in the top left of the page, hover\
  \ over \"IAM & admin\" and click \"Identity & Organization\" in the resulting popout\
  \ menu. It will direct you to a page that will tell you that the page is not viewable\
  \ for projects and ask you to select an organization. Select your organization.\
  \ Select \"IAM\" from the menu on the left. Click the \"ADD\" button towards the\
  \ top of the page and add your Service Account by entering the Client Email associated\
  \ with the Service Account. To grant your Service Account the ability to create\
  \ new project assign your Service Account the roles of Owner and Project Creator.\
  \ To grant your Service Account the ability to update projects, assign your Service\
  \ Account the addional roles of Editor and Project Mover.\n---\n5. **Setup Integration\
  \ Instance**  \nAll the integration parameters to set up an instance are in the\
  \ Service Account Credentials File that was downloaded to your machine in step 1\
  \ when you created a Service Account. Copy each value to its matching integration\
  \ parameter without its surrounding quotes."
