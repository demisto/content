#### New Playbook
This playbook processes indicators by running enrichment, manually reviewing the indicator, and tagging indicators accordingly based on user preferences or enrichment results. Tagging can later be used to update black/white list and other purposes. To process indicators, go to playbook inputs, choose From indicators and set your query (for example: "type:domain").
