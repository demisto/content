# Product/Integration Overview

XM Cyber continuously identifies attack paths to critical assets. This integration retrieves events for newly at-risk critical assets, newly discovered choke points, and changes in overall risk score. Incidents are also enriched with incoming attack vectors to affected endpoints and a list of critical assets exposed by the incident.

## Use Cases

- New attack path to a critical asset triggers alerts and options to quarantine/disconnect/patch
- New attack technique triggers alerts and options to change policy, and scan endpoints
- Incidents from EDRs are enriched with critical asset information and if the severity is high then action can be taken
