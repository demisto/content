# VMRay XSOAR Integration

This integration enables users to design playbooks that involve analyzing a file in VMRay and retrieving the analysis results and associated threat intelligence.


The Playbooks accelerate incident response and make security operations more scalable and efficient.

## Configure VMRay on Cortex XSOAR

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Servers & Services**.
2. Search for VMRay.
3. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration instance.

    | **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Source Reliability | Reliability of the source providing the intelligence data. | False |
    | Server URL (e.g., <https://cloud.vmray.com>) |  | True |
    | API Key (Recommended) |  | False |
    | Use system proxy settings |  | False |
    | Trust any certificate (not secure) |  | False |
    | Retry requests when API is rate limited |  | False |
    | API Key (Deprecated) | Use the "API Key \(Recommended\)" parameter instead. | False |

4. Click **Test** to validate the URLs, token, and connection.

## Known Limitations

- Non-ASCII characters in file names will be ignored when uploading.


## Commands

You can execute these commands from the Cortex XSOAR CLI, as part of an automation, or in a playbook.
After you successfully execute a command, a DBot message appears in the War Room with the command details.
