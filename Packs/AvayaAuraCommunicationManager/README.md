   2. In `Protocol` click the transport protocol that would be used to transfer the syslog messages: **UDP**, **TCP** or **TLS**. 
   3. In `Port` enter the syslog service port that the target Cortex XSIAM Broker VM is listening on for receiving forwarded events from Avaya Aura Communication Manager.
   4. In `Server IP/FQDN` type the IP address of the target [Cortex XSIAM Syslog Broker VM](#broker-vm). 
4. Click **Submit**.  

See Avaya Aura [Configuring syslog server](https://documentation.avaya.com/bundle/AdministeringAvayaAuraCM_R8.1/page/Configuring_systelog_server.html) guide for additional details.


## Collect Events from Vendor

In order to use the collector, use the [Broker VM](#broker-vm) option.

### Broker VM
You will need to use the information described [here](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Pro-Administrator-Guide/Configure-the-Broker-VM).

You can configure the specific vendor and product for this instance.

1. Navigate to **Settings** &rarr; **Configuration** &rarr; **Data Broker** &rarr; **Broker VMs**. 
2. Go to the **APPS** column under the **Brokers** tab and add the **Syslog** app for the relevant broker instance. If the **Syslog** app already exists, hover over it and click **Configure**.
3. Click **Add New**.
3. When configuring the Syslog Collector, set the following parameters:
   | Parameter     | Value    
   | :---          | :---                    
   | `Protocol`    | Select the protocol in correspondence to the protocol that was defined for syslog forwarding on Avaya Aura Communication Manager - **UDP**, **TCP** or **Secure TCP** if the syslog forwarding on the Communication Manager was defined with *TLS*.  
   | `Port`        | Enter the syslog service port that Cortex XSIAM Broker VM should listen on for receiving forwarded events from Avaya Aura Communication Manager. 
   | `Vendor`      | Enter **Avaya**.
