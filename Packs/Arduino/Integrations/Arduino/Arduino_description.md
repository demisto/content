## Arduino
- To configure the integration, simply provide the IP / hostname and port number of the Arduino device that is listening. The code below is an example of what should be running on the Arduino to receive requests from XSOAR.

#### Example Arduino Code

#include <SPI.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include "arduino_secrets.h"

char ssid[] = SECRET_AP;          // your network SSID (name) - This is defined in the "arduino_secrets.h" file
char pass[] = SECRET_KEY;         // your network password  - This is defined in the "arduino_secrets.h" file

/*
   An example of the "arduino.secrets.h" file would be

  #define SECRET_AP "myWiFiNetwork"
  #define SECRET_KEY "myWiFiPassword"
