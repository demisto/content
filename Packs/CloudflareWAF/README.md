### Collect Events from Cloudflare WAF (XSIAM)

We are currently support the retrieval of events from Cloudflare WAF by using an HTTP Log Collector, and Cloudflare waf logpush v2.

**On XSIAM:**

1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Data Sources** -> **Add Data Source** -> **Custom - HTTP based Collector** -> Click on **Connect Another Instance**, set the Name and Compression as you choose and then please set:
   - Name as `Cloudflare`
   - Compression `gzip`
   - Log Format as `JSON`
   - Vendor as `cloudflare`
   - Product as `waf`
2. Creating a new HTTP Log Collector will allow you to generate a unique token, please save it since it will be used later.
3. Click the 3 dots sign next to the newly created instance and copy the API Url, it will also be used later.

**On Cloudflare:**

In order to configure the logpush on cloudflare side, please read [this documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/http/). 

<u>Guidelines:</u>
1. For the **destination_conf**, use the API Url which was copied in section 3 (on the XSIAM side).
2. For the **X-Auth-Key**, use the newly created token mentioned in section 2 (on the XSIAM side).
3. Important: Make sure to specify under **logpull_options** in the Logpush API configuration the next string `EdgeEndTimestamp&timestamps=rfc3339`.
   This is in order to send this time field as a timestamp string, which will be used as the time of the event.
