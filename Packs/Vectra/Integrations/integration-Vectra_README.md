<p>Demisto supports fetching detections directly from Vectra. These are set to trigger incidents in Demisto.</p>
<p>Commands start with !Vectra and can be viewed by clicking <strong>Show commands </strong>in the Settings/Integrations page.</p>

<h3>To set up the integration on Demisto:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to ‘Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Servers &amp; Services’</li>
<li>Locate the Vectra integration by searching for ‘Vectra’ using the search box on the top of the page.</li>
<li>Click ‘Add instance’ to create and configure a new integration. You should configure the following Vectra and Demisto-specific settings:<br> <strong>Name</strong>: A textual name for the integration instance.<br> <strong>Server URL</strong>: The hostname or IP address of the Vectra application. Make sure the URL is reachable with respect to IP address and port.<br> <strong>Credentials and Password</strong>: The username and password, or toggle to Credentials.<br> <strong>Fetch incidents</strong>: Select whether to automatically create Demisto incidents from Vectra offenses. <br> If this option is checked, the first batch of offenses pulled as incidents will be the one raised in last 10 minutes of adding the instance.<br><strong>Do not validate server certificate</strong>: Select to avoid server certification validation. You may want to do this in case Demisto cannot validate the integration server certificate (due to missing CA certificate)<br> <strong>Incident type</strong>: Select to which incident type you want to map Vectra offenses.   <br> <strong>Demisto engine</strong>: If relevant, select the engine that acts as a proxy to the server.<br> Engines are used when you need to access a remote network segments and there are network devices such as proxies, firewalls, etc. that prevent the Demisto server from accessing the remote networks.</li>
