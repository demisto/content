# Deprecation Notice 

The Vectra content pack provided by Cortex XSOAR (named Vectra) will be deprecated in April 2023. A new version of the content pack  (named [Vectra AI](https://cortex.marketplace.pan.dev/marketplace/details/Vectra_AI/)) by Vectra TME  Integrations is available in the Marketplace and those using the Cortex XSOAR (Vectra) content pack are encouraged to migrate to the currently supported Vectra AI content pack. The previous content pack will continue to function but users will need to migrate to the new content pack should support be required.


# Recommended Action
Those using the legacy Vectra content pack should review their playbooks to determine the commands that require migration. The current content pack can support the legacy parameters for ingesting data to create incidents but itâ€™s most likely the user will want to expand the parameters to take advantage of the expanded support the new content pack brings.

See Vectra V2 integration `README` for a list of legacy and replacement commands.
