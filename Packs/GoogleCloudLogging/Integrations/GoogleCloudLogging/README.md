#### Base Command

`gcp-logging-log-entries-list`

#### Input

| **Argument Name** | **Description** | **Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| project_name | A comma-separated list of projects names of parent resources from which to retrieve log entries. A maximum of 100 resources may be specified. | Optional | 
| organization_name | A comma-separated list of organizations names of parent resources from which to retrieve log entries. A maximum of 100 resources may be specified. | Optional | 
| billing_account_name | A comma-separated list of billing accounts names of parent resources from which to retrieve log entries. A maximum of 100 resources may be specified. | Optional | 
| folder_name | A comma-separated list of folders names of parent resources from which to retrieve log entries. A maximum of 100 resources may be specified. | Optional | 
| filter | When specified, the results returned are limited to log entries that match the filter. Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in resourceNames will cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of a filter is 20,000 characters. E.g., "protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerIp:1.1.1.1 AND protoPayload.serviceName:name". | Optional | 
| order_by | How the results should be sorted. Possible values are: timestamp asc, timestamp desc. Default is timestamp asc. | Optional | 
| limit | The maximum number of objects to return. | Optional | 
| page_size | The maximum number of results to return from this request. Default is 50. If the value is negative or exceeds 1000, the request is rejected. | Optional | 
| next_token | If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. pageToken must be the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. | Optional |
