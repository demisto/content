##### EWS O365

- Improved the implementation by consolidating shared code between EWS integrations.
- Fixed an issue where the ***ews-get-items*** command returned an error for certain mailbox items.
- Fixed an issue where the *Test* button and the ***fetch-incidents*** command failed when the *Public Folder* parameter was checked, or when the *is-public* argument was set to `True` in the following commands:
  - ***ews-move_item***
  - ***ews-move-item-between-mailboxes***
  - ***ews-search-mailbox***
  - ***ews-recover-messages***
  - ***ews-get-items-from-folder***
  - ***ews-get-folder***
