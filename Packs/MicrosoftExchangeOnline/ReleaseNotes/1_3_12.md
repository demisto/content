##### O365 - Security And Compliance - Content Search v2

- Fixed an issue where MFA accounts would authenticate using a deprecated application id.
- ***Breaking Change*** - Instances of Security and Compliance which are already configured,
will need to have the command ***o365-sc-auth-start*** ran in order to authenticate the account. 
This version will require a change to the App registration in Azure. Please refer to the description
of the integration for detailed instructions.
