- Fixed a bug when fetching incidents that could result in an incident fetch loop.
- Fixed a bug in the ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **fetch_emails_as_incidents** that 
  could result in duplicated headers in EML file results.
- Fixed an issue so that EML files downloaded from ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **fetch_emails_as_incidents** will now
  retain CRLF line separators
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/py3ews:1.0.0.83462*.
