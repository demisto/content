##### EWS O365

- Fixed bug in incident fetch which could result in an incident fetch loop
- Fixed bug in `ews-get-items-as-eml` command and `fetch_emails_as_incidents` which 
  could result in duplicated headers in EML file results
- EML files downloaded from `ews-get-items-as-eml` command and `fetch_emails_as_incidents` will now
  retain CRLF line separators
