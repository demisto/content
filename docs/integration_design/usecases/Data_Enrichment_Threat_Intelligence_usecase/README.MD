# Data Enrichment & Threat Intelligence

Important information for an indicator:

Top Use-Cases:
Enriching information about different IOC types:
- [upload object for scan and get the scan results. (If there’s a possibility to upload private/public, default should be set to private)](#upload-example).
- [search for former scan results about an object (This way you can get information about a sample without uploading it yourself).](#analysis-example)
- enrich information and scoring for the object.
- Add/Search for indicators in the system.
- Whitelist/ Blacklist indicators.
- Calculate DBot Score for indicators.
