# Integration Design
## Intro
In this tutorial, we'll discuss how to get from an initial need for an integration you want to implement in Demisto, to a design document that will help you become more organized and better understand exactly what it is that you need to implement.

## Why do I need a design document in the first place?
You may be thinking "Why do I need to write a design document? Why not just start writing?". 
Well, we believe that writing a design document _before_ starting any code writing will help you better understand your use of the integration. Additionally, the design document will assist you to better understand exactly what you want to do and what you want to get out of each command or fetch.
(We also require this documentation for our review and final inclusion in Demisto, but the former reason is the more important one).

## Identify What Type of Integration I'm Building
You can divide most integrations in Demisto into one of the following categories. We advise you to try and understand which type is most closely similar to your integration. The following links are to a short list of use-cases for each integration type and showcases a few examples of existing integrations and commands so that you can have a better idea as to how best to implement them:
## Usecases
1. [Analytics and SIEM](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/docs/integration_design/usecases/Analytics_SIEM_usecase)

## Understanding and Documenting the Use-Cases
If you are on your way towards writing an integration for Demisto, you probably are already familiar with the product you want to integrate with. However, it might help to visit the product again to see which actions you want to implement keeping in mind how you think they'll work once integrated with Demisto.

Write down the use cases for your integration, how you would use it, and how you think other people will use the integration.
```Markdown
# Use-Cases:
- Create, get, edit, close a ticket/issue, add & view comments.
- Assign a ticket/issue to a specified user.
- List all tickets, filter by name, date, assignee
```

## Parameters
In this section you will write what are the parameters are needed in order to create an instance of the integration and connect to it. These parameters will be accessible and used in all parts of the integration. 
We require the following two parameters in every integration (if possible).:

| Parameter Name | Display Name | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `proxy` | "Use system proxy settings" | This is a boolean field which handles the system proxy if `True`. |
| `insecure` | "Trust any certificate (not secure)" | This field is a boolean and verifies connections with a valid certificate.|

When implementing the integration, have a look at existing integrations to see how we implement the aforementioned parameters.
If your integration implements `Fetches incidents` also add a boolean field called `isFetch`.

Some other comonly used parameters:
1. `url`
2. `apikey`
3. `token`
4. `credentials` (username + password)
5. `query` - Sometimes we need the user to specify the search query for fetch incidents (i.e. SplunkPy)

## Commands, Arguments & Outputs
Now let's write down exactly what commands you want to implement. Each command has 3 parts:
1. Name
2. Arguments
3. Outputs

#### Command Name
We have a code standard for a command's name which requires the command to contain the brand (`intsights`) and the action (`get-alert-activities`) for the command name. The standard is: `brand-action`
For example `intsights-get-alert-activities`

If your commands enriches an IP/Domain/URL/File, your command should be named simply `ip`\ `domain`\ `url`\ `file` repectively. If this is the case, ensure your outputs match the [context standards](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/docs/context_standards).

#### Command argument
These are the arguments for the command for example `!intsights-get-alert-activities alert-id=`, `!ip ip="8.8.8.8"`
Argument names must be snake case.
* Good: `alert-id`.
* Bad: `alertId`.

#### Command Outputs
There are 3 type of outputs from the command:
1. Human Readable output - This is what will be printed to the war room. It should be in Markdown format.
2. Raw Json - A JSON of the raw response that was returned from the API. 
3. Context Output - The outputs that will be in the context. 

The Context Outupt will be a JSON in the following format `{Product.TypeofOuput.Info}`. For more info about this have a look [here](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/docs/context_and_ouputs)

### Command Design
The final result for each command should look like this:

**Command Name**: `cisco-asa-list-rules`
###### Arguments
argument | type | description|mandatory
---|---|---|---
`interface-name`|String|the name of the interface|no
`interface-type`|choose|In/Out/Global|no

###### Context Outputs
* CiscoASA.Rule.Interface
* CiscoASA.Rule.SourceIP
* CiscoASA.Rule.DestIP
* CiscoASA.Rule.Permit
* CiscoASA.Rule.Active
* CiscoASA.Rule.Remarks
* CiscoASA.Rule.Position
* CiscoASA.Rule.ID
###### Human Readable Output
**All Rules for interface {} of type{}**:

RuleID|InterfaceName|SourceIP|DestIP|Position|
---|---|---|---|---|
124|Some Interface|1.1.1.1|2.2.2.2|6|


## Additional Comments
1. Please add a link to the REST API documentation to this document both so you could have it handy when needed and so we can have it ready when we review the integration.
2. Find a logo for the integration to be displayed in Demisto that is under 10 kb and 120px x 50px.
3. If caclulating DBotScore, stay as close as possible to the vendorâ€™s scoring thresholds and categorization. These are usually documented/can be understood from the UI. DbotScore reputation includes the following scores: 

| Score | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | unknown |
| 1 | good |
| 2 | suspicious |
| 3 | bad |

Give users a threshold argument in order to let customers override and set another scoring logic.

4. The data we return should make sense to an analyst, so please convert epoch timestamps, and decrypt data (if needed). If you return IDs, make sure to return the original asset name, category type, group name, etc.

5. Stay as true to the product as possible and keep the same names as used by the vendor. The UI is a good baseline for what the human readable should look like.

6. If you think a command or fetch may return a lot of data, limit it. We allow 100 results max in Demisto. Make sure to include this in the design for each command that you limit.

7. If some commands may take a long time to return a response, make sure you add a polling command. For example, if you initiate a Compliance Search in EWS, an action that may take several minutes, make sure you have a `check-status` command as well. 

8. If a command needs major changes, deprecate it and add a new one.
