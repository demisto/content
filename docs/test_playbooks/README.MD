# Overview
We currently use CircleCI to test each of our integrations. The tests run for **your** integration each time you commit to the content repo. Tests for **every** integration runs nightly. Perhaps the easiest way to create a test playbook is via the Demisto Playbook Editor and remains the preferred way to create one.

### Every pull request _must_ have a test playbook. 

## Creating a Test Playbook

### Getting Started
To create a test playbook, we begin by navigating to the **Playbooks** tab in Demisto and clicking **New Playbook**. When running a test, it is often necessary for the first step to be **DeleteContext** which is found under the **Utilities** section in the Task Library. Make sure to select "yes" for the field "all". Finally click okay and connect the **Playbook Triggered** task to the **DeleteContext** task as shown below:

### Testing a Command
It is important to test as many parts of the integration as possible and it is suggested to have a task for each command. For this example we will look at the Integration IPInfo. IPInfo accepts only one command called ```!ip```. A search for ipinfo in the Task Library will display the command "ip". Click **Add** to bring up the configuration options. 

When we run a test against an entity such as an IP address, or domain, we must select an entity that will give us the most *consistent* results. We will use Google's 8.8.8.8 as an example in the configuration below.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912128/50276007-8448d480-0449-11e9-9413-67a842a8ce72.png" width="400" align="middle">

Click **OK** to save your changes and finally connect "ip" task to the "DeleteContext" task.

### Verifying Results
Once we have built a command task, we must next verify that the results are what we expected to receive. To do this, we will open the **Task Library** and select **Create Task**. Click the radio button next to "Conditional" to open the options for conditions as seen below:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912128/50276352-6fb90c00-044a-11e9-8210-a4df27b9500c.png" width="400" align="middle">

Under the section "Condition for yes", we will click the **{}** option to bring up the source tool. You will see an option for the task we have just created called "#2 ip". Click the "Address" option. 

**Please note:** If you need to filter or format the result, click "Filter and Operations" to do so.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912128/50276603-fff75100-044a-11e9-97ef-c848cc051985.png" width="400" align="middle">

We now must wrap the Context Path like this **${IP.Address}**. This tells Demisto that we are looking for the value present at that location.

Next, in the "Equals (String)" field enter our expected value of "8.8.8.8" and click âœ… followed by **Save**. Connect the tasks together. 

Lastly we will close the investigation if the test is successful. To do this find "closeInvestigation" in the Task Library and click "add". For the "id" field, select "ID" path found under "Incident details" in the source tool. Click "OK" and connect the task to the others.

### Naming and Exporting the Playbook
We use a standard naming convention for our playbook tests which follows the format below:

```Integration_Name-Test```

Click "Save Version" and exit the Playbook editor.

Lastly, we need to download the YAML file for the Playbook we have just created. Click ![download button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912128/50277516-4d74bd80-044d-11e9-94b6-5195dd0db796.png) to export the playbook.

## Adding the Playbook to your Project
With the YAML file we have just created, edit the ```id```  to be the same as the field ```name```. Next we change the ```version``` field to "-1" to prevent changes. using the example above, the top of your YAML should look like this:

```yml
id: IPInfo-Test
version: -1
name: IPInfo-Test
```

## Adding Tests to conf.json
The conf.json file (located in the "Tests" directory) is where we tell CircleCI which tests to run and for which integrations.

Your conf.json entry for the integration should be similar to the following:
```yml
        {
            "integrations": "Forcepoint",
            "playbookID": "forcepoint test",
            "timeout": 500,
            "nightly": true
        },
```
An explanation of the fields are as follows:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| **integrations** | The ID of the integration you are testing |
| **playbookID** | The ID of the test playbook |
| **timeout** | Time in seconds to extend the timeout to |
| **nightly** | Boolean to indicate if the test should be part of the nightly tests **only** |

If your integration requires a configuration in order to be executed, add the following to the [content-test-conf/conf.json](https://github.com/demisto/content-test-conf/blob/master/conf.json) file. The field names should match what you have assigned as the parameters for your integration.

```yml
{
  "name": "carbonblack-v2",
  "params": {
    "serverurl": "https://example:30035/",
    "apitoken": "exampleapikey",
    "insecure": true,
    "proxy": false
  }
}
```

Finally commit, push your changes, and cross your fingers. If everything works well, you should have a "Green Build"
