# Fetching Incidents

## Overview
Demisto can pull events from 3rd party tools and convert them into actionable incidents. There are a few important parts that are necessary to keep in mind while doing so and they are outlined below.

## ```fetch-incidents``` Command
The ```fetch incidents``` command is the function that Demisto calls every minute to import new incidents and is triggered by the "Fetches incidents" parameter in the integration configuration. It is not necessary to configure the ```fetch-incidents``` command in the Integration Settings.

Let's walk through the example below:

First we open up the command called "fetch-incidents". Make sure that the command is also referenced in the execution block as well.

```python
def fetch_incidents():
      # your implementation here


if demisto.command() == 'fetch-incidents':
      fetch_incidents()

```

### Last Run
demisto.getLastRun() is the function that retrieves the previous run time. To avoid duplicating incidents, it's important that Demisto only fetches events that occurred since the last time the function was run. This helps avoid duplicate incidents.

```python
    # demisto.getLastRun() will returns an obj with the previous run in it.
    last_run = demisto.getLastRun()
```

## First Run
When an integration runs for the first time, the Last Run time will not be in the integration context. We catch this from failing by using an ```if``` statement. When the last run time is not specified, we use a time that is specified in the integration settings.

It is best practices to allow a customer to specify how far back in time they wish to fetch incidents on the first run. This is a configurable Parameter in the integration settings.

### Query and Parameters

Queries and parameters allow for filtering of events to take place. In some cases, a customer may only wish to import certain event types into Demisto. In this case, they would need to query the API for only that specific event type. These should be configurable Parameters in the integration settings.

The following example shows how we use both **First Run** and the **Query** option:
```python
    # usually there will be some kind of query based on event creation date, 
    # or get all the events with id greater than X id and their status is New
    query = 'status=New'

    day_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1) 
    start_time = day_ago.time()
    if last_run and last_run.has_key('start_time'):
        start_time = last_run.get('start_time')

    # execute the query and get the events
    events = query_events(query, start_time)
```

## Creating an Incident
Incidents are created by building an array of incident objects. These object all must contain the ```name``` of the incident, when the incident ```occurred``` as well as the ```rawJSON``` for the incident.

```python
    # convert the events to demisto incident 
    incidents = []
    for event in events:
        incident = {
            'name': event['name'],        # name is required field, must be set
            'occurred': event['create_time'], # occurred is optional date
            'rawJSON': json.dumps(event)  # set the original event to rawJSON, this will allow mapping of the event. Don't forget to `json.dumps`
        }
        incident.append(incident)
```

### rawJSON
When fetching incidents, it's important to include the ```rawJson``` key in the incident field, which enables event mapping. Mapping is how an event gets imported into Demisto, since it allows a customer to choose which data from the event to be mapped to their proper fields. An example of this is below:

```python
        incident = {
            'name': event['name'],        # name is required field, must be set
            'occurred': event['create_time'], # occurred is optional date
            'rawJSON': json.dumps(event)  # set the original event to rawJSON, this will allow mapping of the event. Don't forget to `json.dumps`
        }
```


### Setting Last Run
When the last of the events have been retrieved, we need to save the new last run time to the integration context. This timestamp will be used the next time the ```fetch-incidents``` function is run.
When setting the last run object, it's important to know that the values of the dictionairy must be of type `string`.

```python
    demisto.setLastRun({
        'start_time': datetime.now()
    })
```
## Sending the Incidents to Demisto
When all of the incidents have been created, we return the array of incidents by using the ```demisto.incidents()``` function. This is similar to the ```demisto.results()``` function, but is used exclusively to handle incident objects.

An example of it's usage is below:

```python
    # this command will create incidents in Demisto
    demisto.incidents(incidents)
```
