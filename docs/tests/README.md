# Overview
We use *CircleCI* to test our integrations. The tests for **your** integration run each time you commit to the content repo. The tests for **every** integration run every night. The easiest, and preferred, way to create a test playbook is by using the Demisto playbook editor.

When creating a test playbook:
* Every pull request _must_ have a test playbook.
* Unit tests should be used to test smaller units of code. For more information, see [Unit Testing](docs/unit-testing/README.md).

# Create a Test Playbook
After you create a test playbook, there are several tests you should run, including testing commands, verifying the results, and closing the investigation.
## Create a playbook
1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. Define a **Playbook name**.
3. In the search field, type **deletecontext** and click **Utilities**.
4. In the **DeleteContext** task, click **Add**.
5. From the dropdown menu in the **all** field, select **yes**.
6. Click **OK** and connect the **Playbook Triggered** task to the **DeleteContext** task.

# Testing a Command, Verifying the Results, and Closing an Investigation

It's important to test as many commands of the integration as possible as tasks, and each command should have a task. For example, the *IPIinfo* integration is a command and requires a task, (the `!ip` command).

## Test a Command

1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. In the search field, type **ipinfo** and click **ip**.
3. In the **ip** task, click **Add** to edit the configuration options.
4. Select an entity that will produce the most *consistent* results in the *ip* field, such as 8.8.8.8, the Google DNS server.
5. Click **OK** to save your changes.
6. Connect the **DeleteContext** task to the **ip** task.

## Verify the Command Results
After you build the command, verify that you have received the results that you expect.
1. Open the **Task Library** and select **Create Task**.
2. Configure the new task.

| Configuration | Action |
| ---- | ----| 
| **Conditional** | Select the **Conditional** button to display the condition options. |
| **Task Name** | Type a task name. |
| **From previous tasks** |  Click **{}** to display the **Select source for** tool. The **Select source for** tool displays the **#2 ip** task that you created. |
| **2 ip** | Click to display the **ip** task configurations. |
| **IP** | Click **Address** and click **Close**. The `IP.Address` is displayed in the **From previous tasks** field. This is the Context Path. |
| **From previous tasks** | Wrap the Context Path using this format `${IP.Address}`. Wrapping the Context Path tells Demisto to retrieve the value located in the curly brackets. |
| **As value** | Type 8.8.8.8 and click âœ…. |

**Note:** If you need to edit the value in a field, you can click on the value and edit it. For example, click on the value in the **From previous tasks** field and edit the `${IP.Address}` value.

3. Optional: If you need to filter or format the result, click **Filters and Operations** located in the **Select source for** dialog box.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Connect the **ip** task to the **Verify Command Results** task.

## Close the Investigation
1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. In the search field, type **closeinvestigation** and click **BuiltIn Commands**.
3. For **closeInvestigation**, click **Add**.
4. Click the **{}** in the *id* field.
5. Click **Incident details** and find **ID**. `${incident.id}` is inserted into the **id** field.
6. Click **Close** and click **OK**.
7. Connect the **Verify Command Results** task to the **closeInvestigation** task.
8. Choose the **yes** label name for the condition and click **Save**.

### Naming and Exporting the Playbook
Demisto uses a standard naming convention for playbook tests that follows this format: `Integration_Name-Test`.

1. Click **Save Version**.
2. Exit the playbook editor.
3. Export the playbook by clicking ![download button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912128/50277516-4d74bd80-044d-11e9-94b6-5195dd0db796.png).

## Adding the Playbook to your Project
1. In the YAML file that you created, edit the `id` so that it is identical to the `name` field.
2. Modify the value in the `version` field to *-1* to prevent user changes.
3. Using the example above, the top of your YAML should look like this:

```yml
id: IPInfo-Test
version: -1
name: IPInfo-Test
```

## Adding Tests to conf.json
The *CircleCI* is set to run integration tests from the conf.json file. The conf.json file is located in the **Tests** directory.

The following is an example of a correct conf.json entry for an integration:
```yml
        {
            "integrations": "Forcepoint",
            "playbookID": "forcepoint test",
            "timeout": 500,
            "nightly": true
        },
```
The following table describes the fields:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| **integrations** | The ID of the integration that you are testing. |
| **playbookID** | The ID of the test playbook that you are running. |
| **timeout** | The time in seconds to extend the timeout to. |
| **nightly** | Boolean that indicates if the test should be part of **only** the nightly tests. |

1. If your integration must be configured to be executed, you must add the code below to the [content-test-conf/conf.json](https://github.com/demisto/content-test-conf/blob/master/conf.json) file. The field names must match the parameters that you assigned to your integration.

```yml
{
  "name": "carbonblack-v2",
  "params": {
    "serverurl": "https://example.com:30035/",
    "apitoken": "exampleapikey",
    "insecure": true,
    "proxy": false
  }
}
```

2. Commit, push your changes, and cross your fingers. If everything works well, you should have a "Green Build".
