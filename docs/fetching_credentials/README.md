# Fetching Credentials

As seen [here](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002567894), it is possible to integrate with 3rd party credentials 
vaults for Demisto to use when authenticating with integrations. This article provides an example of such integration.

## Requirements

In order to fetch credentials to the Demisto credentials store, the integration needs to be able to retrieve credential objects 
in the format of a username and password (key:value).

## Implementation

### isFetchCredentials Parameter
  
For this example we are going to look at the HasiCorp Vault integration. The first thing you need to do is add a boolean parameter with the name:
`isFetchCredentials`(You can give it a different display name). When this parameter is set to true, Demisto will fetch credentials from the integration.
It would look like something like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35098543/53886096-eae09600-4027-11e9-8c2d-a46078c3dcc4.png)

### fetch-credentials Command

When Demisto tries to fetch credentials from the integrations, it will call a command called `fetch-credentials`.
This is where you should implement the credentials retrieving logic:
```python
if demisto.command() == 'fetch-credentials':
   fetch_credentials()
```
 

### Creating credentials objects

In the `fetch_credentials` function, you should retrieve the credentials from the vault and create new JSON objects in the format:
```json
{
  "user": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "name": "name"
}
```


In the end you should have a credentials list that contains the above objects.


When you're done creating the credentials objects, send them to the credentials store by using:
`demisto.credentials(credentials)`.

### Runtime
When an integration instance is configured with credentials from a vault, each time credentials are needed Demisto
will query the vault integration with an `identifier` for the relevant integration as an argument to the `fetch_credentials` command (accessible via the `args` 
object). `identifier` reflects the `name` property of the credentials object.
It is important to use it to return only **one** set of credentials for the relevant integration,
because in this case, if multiple credentials sets are returned, the process will fail and an error will be thrown.

## Result
If everything went well you should be able to see the credentials in the Demisto credentials store:

Note that these credentials cannot be edited or deleted, they reflect what's in the vault. You can stop fetching credentials by unticking the 
`Fetch Credentials` checkbox in the integration settings.


## Troubleshooting
In case of an error during the process, you can debug your code by adding a test command that calls the `fetch_credentials` function.
Make sure you send a credentials list in the right format and as a valid JSON.
