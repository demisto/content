comment: ' The endpoint status request enables a client application to enroll an endpoint
  or revoke its enrollment. This is usually relevant for endpoints with pending status
  but can be done for endpoints with any current status. The endpoint needs to be
  specified by its ID, which can have been received from an endpoints list request,
  from a new endpoint notification, or from any other implemented manual or automated
  input.'
