# There are two use-cases to use this script:
# 1. Running the script on local branch
# The script will get local_branch_name, circleCi token and time_to_live argument (in minutes) and set the instances in the build according to the given time.
# For example:
# ./Utils/trigger_content_build_with_time_to_live.sh my_branch_name <CircleCi token> 360
# After running this command line  it will trigger a build on the given branch and all of the instances will live for 6 hours.
# in this case, if you donâ€™t specify time to live argument the default will be 180 minutes.

# 2. Running the script with the contributor changes
# The script will get local_branch_name, circleCi token, time to live argument(in minutes), contributor_user_name:contributor_branch_name and the pack path of the pack that has been changed/added.
# For example:
# ./Utils/trigger_content_build_with_time_to_live.sh content_branch_name <CircleCiToken> 420 contrib_name:contrib_branch_name Packs/New_Pack/
# In this case, the script will trigger a build and the demisto-marketplace instance will live for 7 hours.
# Notice that if you want to run a build on contributor branch you must specify time to live argument and the recommended time is 180 minutes.
