 Before you can use AWS Access Analyzer, you need to perform several configuration steps in your AWS environment.

### Prerequisites
- Attach an instance profile with the required permissions to the Demisto server or engine that is running on your AWS environment.
- Instance Profile requires minimum permission: sts:AssumeRole.
- Instance Profile requires permission to assume the roles needed by the AWS integrations.

### Configure AWS Settings
- Create an IAM Role for the Instance Profile.
- Attach a Role to the Instance Profile.
- Configure the Necessary IAM Roles that the AWS Integration Can Assume.
