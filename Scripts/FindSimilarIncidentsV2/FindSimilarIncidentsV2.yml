  Find similar incidents by common incident keys, labels, custom fields or context keys.
  It's highly recommended to use incident keys if possible (e.g. "type" for same incident type).
  It's also recommended to avoid using context keys if possible (for example, if the value also appear in label key, use label) for better performance.
