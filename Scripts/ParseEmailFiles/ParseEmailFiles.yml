comment: Parse an email from an eml or msg file and populate all relevant context
  data to investigate the email. Also extracts inner attachments and returns them
  to the war room. The incident labels themselves are preserved and not modified -
  only the "Label/x" context items that originated from the labels, and the best practice
  is to rely on these for the remainder of the playbook.
