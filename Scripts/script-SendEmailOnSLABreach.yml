  # ##### Help #####
  # This is an example script. The script is used to send an email once an SLA is breached. Please copy this script and make changes to your liking.
  # The Configuration section is there to help you easily configure the script with your desired email recipient, the subject of the email, and the body.
  # If you want to use this script, you should go to the SLA field that would trigger it, and set this script as the script to run on SLA breach.
