releaseNotes: "Reimplemented ReadPDFFile script. Deprecated maxFileSize (as it wasn't used) and added new functionality:
               - Expanded metadata: metadata displays more information than before.
               - Shows pdf images: The script extracts the images in the pdf, and displays them (as a fileEntry) in the war room.
               - Added argument 'maxImages': max amount of images to extract from the pdf (default is 20).
               - Added support for encrypted file - added new argument for encrypted files (userPassword)."
