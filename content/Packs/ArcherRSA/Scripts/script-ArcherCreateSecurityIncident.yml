  This script is used to simplify the process of creating a new record in Archer.

  You can add fields that you want in the record as script arguments and or in the

  code and have a newly created record easily.


  This automation is currently used for Archer application 75 (Security Incidents)

  but can be altered to any other application by entering another application Id as

  input or modifying the ApplicationId argument default value.Another option would

  be to duplicate this script and adjust it to the new application Id.


  Mandatory fields in your Archer setting should be changed to be mandatory arguments in this script.

  You can identify such fields by trying to create a new record, you would receive a response

  stating that Archer is missing a certain field.


  Please note that if you will change it to work with another application some of the argument

  defined fields might need to be changed as they belong to application 75.

  If you want to add some constant args you can modify fieldsToValues

  and add them inside it as key:value pairs

  Demisto script arguments cannot have spaces or special char such '/' in their name.

  Therefore, we are transforming some values which are have such structure in Archer

  from their script argument structure to their Archer structure.


  If you add such arguments to the script add them to this dictionary as well.
