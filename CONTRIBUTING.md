# Content Contribution Guide

## Contributing Playbooks

Our playbooks are described in an open format called [COPS](https://github.com/demisto/COPS) which we released as an initiative to drive collaboration and interoperability within the InfoSec community.

In order to contribute playbooks you need to save them in the COPS format (as a yaml file) and create a Pull Request.

You can also edit them visually inside the Demisto Platform and then export to a yaml file.

To add a new playbook, or modify and enhance an existing playbook - just open a Pull Request in this repo.

## Contributing Scripts

Each of our scripts comes as a self-contained yml file that includes the script itself (in Python or Javascript) as well as its description, arguments, and more.

Here is a description of the script yml format's fields and structure:

``` yaml
commonfields:
  id: MyScript
  version: -1
name: MyScript
script: |-
  //Execute a command on a remote machine
  var entries = executeCommand("ssh", args);
  if (entries[0].Contents === null) {
      output.push({ContentsFormat: formats.text, Type: entryTypes.error, Contents: "Failed to execute remote command."});
  } else {
      return entries[0];     
  }
  return output;
type: javascript
tags:
- endpoint
- ssh
comment: Execute a command via ssh
args:
- name: system
  required: true
  description: Name of system on which to run the command
- name: cmd
  required: true
  description: Command to run
scripttarget: 0
dependson:
  must:
  - ssh
system: false
timeout: 0s
```

* id: internal id for the script - make sure it doesn't conflict with an existing script
* name: Name for the script, that will be displayed in the Automation page
* script: The script itself in Python or Javascript
* type: `javascript` or `python`
* tags: array of tags of the script
* comment: A brief description of the script's purpose and any other important things to know - appears in the Automation page and in the CLI autocomplete.
* arguments: array of script arguments
	* name: argument name
    * description: argument description - appears in automation page and in the CLI autocomplete
    * required: Whether the user must provide this argument to run the script - yes for mandatory, no for optional
    * default: (Only one "yes" per script) Argument can be provided without its name - e.g. `!whois google.com` instead of `!whois domain=google.com`
* system: "yes" if the script is provided with the platform and is locked and unmodifiable - set to "no" for scripts user creates from within the product.
* scriptTarget: 0 for server script, 1 for agent script (to be run by the Demisto d2 dissolvable agent on the endpoint side)
* dependsOn: The commands required for the script to be used - if these commands are unavailable (e.g. because no integration that implements them has been configured) then the script will not appear in the CLI's autocomplete (it can still be viewed and edited on the Automation page).

If you have a suggestion or an opportunity for improvement that you've identified, please open an issue in this repo.
