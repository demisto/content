        5. Create subgraph of packs to install and their dependencies.
        6. Merge packs with circular dependencies into single, to make DAG graph.
        7. Get a sorted list of packs to install based on the DAG graph, using topological sort.
        8. Create the request body to install packs by calling create_install_request_body.
        9. Create batches of packs to install if install_packs_in_batches is True.
        10. Install packs using the Demisto client.
