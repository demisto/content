  # This is an example script. The script is used to stop the Time to Assignment SLA field, once an owner was set to an incident.
  # If you want to use this script, you should go to the Time to Assignment SLA field, and set this script as the script to run upon change of field value.

  if not demisto.args().get('old') and demisto.args().get('new'):  # If owner was no-one and is now someone:
      demisto.executeCommand("stopTimer", {"timerField":"timetoassignment"})
      demisto.results("Assignment of the incident was successful and so the Time To Assignment timer has been stopped.")
