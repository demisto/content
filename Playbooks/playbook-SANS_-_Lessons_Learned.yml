        “The purpose of this phase is to complete any documentation that was not done during the incident, as well as any additional documentation that may be beneficial in future incidents.
        The document should also be written in a form of a report to provide a play-by-play review of the entire incident; this report should be able to answer the: Who, What, Where, Why, and How questions that may come up during the lessons learned meeting.
        The overall goal is to learn from the incidents that occurred within an organization to improve the team’s performance and provide reference materials in the event of a
        similar incident.
        The lessons learned meeting should be performed as soon as possible”
